@article{Das2007,
abstract = {Several approaches to collaborative filtering have been stud- ied but seldom have studies been reported for large (several million users and items) and dynamic (the underlying item set is continually changing) settings. In this paper we de- scribe our approach to collaborative filtering for generating personalized recommendations for users of Google News. We generate recommendations using three approaches: collabo- rative filtering using MinHash clustering, Probabilistic La- tent Semantic Indexing (PLSI), and covisitation counts. We combine recommendations from different algorithms using a linear model. Our approach is content agnostic and con- sequently domain independent, making it easily adaptable for other applications and languages with minimal effort. This paper will describe our algorithms and system setup in detail, and report results of running the recommendations engine on Google News.},

Sequential agglomerative hierarchical clustering schemes are considered in particular detail, and several new methods are proposed. The new algorithms are characterized by their ability to "adapt" to the possible trends of variation found within clusters as they are being formed. A nonlinear version allows the isolation and description of clusters which are parabolic, ring-shaped, etc., by the introduction of appropriate dummy variables. Procedures for computing the best fitting trend line through the cluster are also presented, and problems in measuring the amount of information lost by clustering are discussed.

@article{Azaria2013,
abstract = {Traditional recommender systems minimize prediction error with respect to users’ choices. Recent studies have shown that recom- mender systems have a positive effect on the provider’s revenue. In this paper we show that by providing a set of recommenda- tions different than the one perceived best according to user ac- ceptance rate, the recommendation system can further increase the business’ utility (e.g. revenue), without any significant drop in user satisfaction. Indeed, the recommendation system designer should have in mind both the user, whose taste we need to reveal, and the business, which wants to promote specific content. We performed a large body of experiments comparing a commer- cial state-of-the-art recommendation engine with a modified rec- ommendation list, which takes into account the utility (or revenue) which the business obtains from each suggestion that is accepted by the user. We show that the modified recommendation list is more desirable for the business, as the end result gives the business a higher utility (or revenue). To study possible reduce in satisfaction by providing the user worse suggestions, we asked the users how they perceive the list of recommendation that they received. Dif- ferences in user satisfaction between the lists is negligible, and not statistically significant. We also uncover a phenomenon where movie consumers prefer watching and even paying for movies that they have already seen in the past than movies that are new to them.},

@phdthesis{Guo2011,
abstract = {This thesis is about how Bayesian methods can be applied to explicitly model and efficiently reason about uncertainty to make optimal recommendations. We are interested in three dimensions of recommender systems: (1) preference elicitation, (2) set-based recommendations, and (3) matchmaking. The first dimension concerns how one can minimize the elicitation efforts in learning a user’s utility function to propose the maximal utility recommendation. The second dimension concerns set-based recommendations, and the problem of how one can optimize the relevance of the recommended set, with respect to uncertainty over the relevance of each item in the set. The third dimension concerns the problem of matchmaking, which is the process of pairing competitors based on similar latent skill levels, given match outcomes, e.g., score, or win/lose/draw. All three dimensions face an inherent problem of handling uncertainty: user utility uncertainty for preference elicitation, query topic uncertainty for set-based retrieval in the context of document retrieval, and skill uncertainty in match- making. Bayesian approaches prove to be extremely flexible in modeling various problems, and are robust to risk. However, it is not until recently that efficient Bayesian inference techniques have been introduced for complex models. Thus, we utilize recent advances in Bayesian approaches for addressing these three problems. Our contributions in the thesis are twofold. First, we present compact Bayesian graphical models for dimensions (1)–(3). Second, for each dimension, we make use of advanced Bayesian inference techniques to learn and make optimal recommendations.},

Such a tool—a quantitative measure of similarity— can be used to build classification, retrieval, browsing, and recommendation systems. To develop such a measure, however, presupposes some ground truth, a single underlying similarity that constitutes the desired output of the measure.

Some believe recommenders help consumers discover new products and thus increase sales diversity. Others believe recommenders only reinforce the popularity of already popular products. This paper seeks to reconcile these seemingly incompatible views. We explore the question in two ways. First, modeling recommender systems analytically allows us to explore their path dependent effects. Second, turning to simulation, we increase the realism of our results by combining choice models with actual implementations of recommender systems. We arrive at three main results. First, some well known recommenders can lead to a reduction in sales diversity. Because common recommenders (e.g., collaborative filters) recommend products based on sales and ratings, they cannot recommend products with limited historical data, even if they would be rated favorably. In turn, these recommenders can create a rich-get-richer effect for popular products and vice-versa for unpopular ones. This bias toward popularity can prevent what may otherwise be better consumer-product matches. That diversity can decrease is surprising to consumers who express that recommendations have helped them discover new products. In line with this, result two shows that it is possible for individual-level diversity to increase but aggregate diversity to decrease. Recommenders can push each person to new products, but they often push users toward the same products.. Third, we show how basic design choices affect the outcome, and thus managers can choose recommender designs that are more consistent with their sales goals and consumers’ preferences.},

We present a general method based on the weighted majority algorithm for using any online learner for concept drift. Dynamic weighted majority (DWM) maintains an ensemble of base learners, predicts using a weighted-majority vote of these "experts", and dynamically creates and deletes experts in response to changes in performance. We empirically evaluated two experimental systems based on the method using incremental naive Bayes and incremental tree inducer [ITI] as experts. For the sake of comparison, we also included Blum's implementation of weighted majority. On the STAGGER concepts and on the SEA concepts, results suggest that the ensemble method learns drifting concepts almost as well as the base algorithms learn each concept individually. Indeed, we report the best overall results for these problems to date.},

abstract = {Two fuzzy versions of the k-means optimal, least squared error partitioning problem are formulated for finite subsets X of a general inner product space. In both cases, the extremizing solutions are shown to be fixed points of a certain operator T on the class of fuzzy, k-partitions of X, and simple iteration of T provides an algorithm which has the descent property relative to the least squared error criterion function. In the first case, the range of T consists largely of ordinary (i.e. non-fuzzy) partitions of X and the associated iteration scheme is essentially the well known ISODATA process of Ball and Hall. However, in the second case, the range of T consists mainly of fuzzy partitions and the associated algorithm is new; when X consists of k compact well separated (CWS) clusters, Xi , this algorithm generates a limiting partition with membership functions which closely approximate the characteristic functions of the clusters Xi . However, when X is not the union of k CWS clusters, the limiting partition is truly fuzzy in the sense that the values of its component membership functions differ substantially from 0 or 1 over certain regions of X. Thus, unlike ISODATA, the “fuzzy” algorithm signals the presence or absence of CWS clusters in X. Furthermore, the fuzzy algorithm seems significantly less prone to the “cluster-splitting” tendency of ISODATA and may also be less easily diverted to uninteresting locally optimal partitions. Finally, for data sets X consisting of dense CWS clusters embedded in a diffuse background of strays, the structure of X is accurately reflected in the limiting partition generated by the fuzzy algorithm. Mathematical arguments and numerical results are offered in support of the foregoing assertions.},

However, when the same query is submitted by different users, typical search engines return the same result regardless of who submitted the query. Generally, each user has different information needs for his/her query. Therefore, the search results should be adapted to users with different information needs. In this paper, we first propose several approaches to adapting search results according to each user’s need for relevant information without any user effort, and then verify the effectiveness of our pro- posed approaches.

@book{Quinlan1993a,
abstract = {Classifier systems play a major role in machine learning and knowledge-based systems, and Ross Quinlan's work on ID3 and C4.5 is widely acknowledged to have made some of the most significant contributions to their development. This book is a complete guide to the C4.5 system as implemented in C for the UNIX environment. It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. The source code and sample datasets are also available for download (see below).C4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting. Advantages and disadvantages of the C4.5 approach are discussed and illustrated with several case studies.This book and software should be of interest to developers of classification-based intelligent systems and to students in machine learning and expert systems courses.},

@article{Cremonesi2010b,
abstract = {In many commercial systems, the ‘best bet’ recommenda- tions are shown, but the predicted rating values are not. This is usually referred to as a top-N recommendation task, where the goal of the recommender system is to find a few specific items which are supposed to be most appealing to the user. Common methodologies based on error metrics (such as RMSE) are not a natural fit for evaluating the top- N recommendation task. Rather, top-N performance can be directly measured by alternative methodologies based on accuracy metrics (such as precision/recall). An extensive evaluation of several state-of-the art recom- mender algorithms suggests that algorithms optimized for minimizing RMSE do not necessarily perform as expected in terms of top-N recommendation task. Results show that improvements in RMSE often do not translate into accu- racy improvements. In particular, a naive non-personalized algorithm can outperform some common recommendation approaches and almost match the accuracy of sophisticated algorithms. Another finding is that the very few top popular items can skew the top-N performance. The analysis points out that when evaluating a recommender algorithm on the top-N recommendation task, the test set should be chosen carefully in order to not bias accuracy metrics towards non- personalized solutions. Finally, we offer practitioners new variants of two collaborative filtering algorithms that, re- gardless of their RMSE, significantly outperform other rec- ommender algorithms in pursuing the top-N recommenda- tion task, with offering additional practical advantages. This comes at surprise given the simplicity of these two methods.},

LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

abstract = {The paper combines a comprehensive account of aprobabilisticmodel of retrieval with new systematic experiments on TREC Programme material. It presents the model from its foundations through its logical development to cover more aspects of retrieval data and a wider range of system functions. Each step in the argument is matched by comparativeretrieval tests, to provide a single coherent account of a major line of research. The experiments demonstrate, for a large test collection, that the probabilisticmodel is effective and robust, and that it responds appropriately, with major improvements in performance, to key features of retrieval situations. Part 1 covers the foundations and the modeldevelopment for document collection and relevance data, along with the test apparatus. Part 2 covers the further development and elaboration of the model, with extensive testing, and briefly considers other environment conditions and tasks, model training, concluding with comparisons with other approaches and an overall assessment. Data and results tables forboth partsare given in Part 1. Key results are summarised in Part 2.},

abstract = {Although temporal context may significantly affect the popularity of items and user preference over items, traditional information filtering techniques such as recommender systems have not sufficiently considered temporal factors. Modeling temporal dynamics in user behavior is not trivial, and it is challenging to study its effect in order to provide better recommendation results to users. To incorporate temporal effects into information filtering systems, we analyze a large sized real-world usage log data gathered from Bugs Music, which is one of the well-known online music service in Korea, and study temporal dynamics in users' music listening behaviors considering periodicity of time dimension and popularity change. We insist that the result of our analysis can be a useful guideline to the industry which delivers music items to users and tries to consider temporal context in their recommendations.},

Written from a computer science perspective by three leading experts in the field, it gives an up-to-date treatment of all aspects of the design and implementation of systems for gathering, indexing, and searching documents; methods for evaluating systems; and an introduction to the use of machine learning methods on text collections. All the important ideas are explained using examples and figures, making it perfect for introductory courses in information retrieval for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in computer science. Based on feedback from extensive classroom experience, the book has been carefully structured in order to make teaching more natural and effective. Although originally designed as the primary text for a graduate or advanced undergraduate course in information retrieval, the book will also create a buzz for researchers and professionals alike.},

@article{Wang2003,
abstract = {An effective processing and analysis of data streams is of utmost importance for a plethora of emerging applications like network monitoring, traffic management, and financial tickers. In addition to the management of transient and potentially unbounded streams, their analysis with advanced data mining techniques has been identified as a research challenge. A wellestablished class of mining techniques is based on nonparametric statistics where especially nonparametric density estimation is among the essential building blocks. In this paper, we examine the maintenance of nonparametric estimators over data streams. We present a tailored framework that incrementally maintains a nonparametric estimator over a data stream while consuming only a fixed amount of memory. Our framework is memory-adaptive and therefore, supports a fundamental requirement for an operator within a data stream management system. As an example, we apply our framework to selectivity estimation of range queries, which is a popular use-case for statistical estimators. After providing an analysis of the processing cost, results of experimental comparisons are reported where synthetic data streams as well as real-world ones are considered. Our results demonstrate the accuracy of the results being produced by estimators derived from our framework.},

abstract = {In the past decade large scale recommendation datasets were pub- lished and extensively studied. In this work we describe a detailed analysis of a sparse, large scale dataset, specifically designed to push the envelope of recommender system models. The Yahoo! Music dataset consists of more than a million users, 600 thousand musical items and more than 250 million ratings, collected over a decade. It is characterized by three unique features: First, rated items are multi-typed, including tracks, albums, artists and genres; Second, items are arranged within a four level taxonomy, proving itself effective in coping with a severe sparsity problem that origi- nates from the unusually large number of items (compared to, e.g., movie ratings datasets). Finally, fine resolution timestamps associ- ated with the ratings enable a comprehensive temporal and session analysis. We further present a matrix factorization model exploiting the special characteristics of this dataset. In particular, the model incorporates a rich bias model with terms that capture information from the taxonomy of items and different temporal dynamics of music ratings. To gain additional insights of its properties, we or- ganized the KddCup-2011 competition about this dataset. As the competition drew thousands of participants, we expect the dataset to attract considerable research activity in the future.},

abstract = {Recommender systems use data on past user preferences to predict possible future likes and interests. A key challenge is that while the most useful individual recommendations are to be found among diverse niche objects, the most reliably accurate results are obtained by methods that recommend objects based on user or object similarity. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm specifically to address the challenge of diversity and show how it can be used to resolve this apparent dilemma when combined in an elegant hybrid with an accuracy-focused algorithm. By tuning the hybrid appropriately we are able to obtain, without relying on any semantic or context-specific information, simultaneous gains in both accuracy and diversity of recommendations.},

abstract = {User experience in social media involves rich interactions with the media content and other participants in the commu- nity. In order to support such communities, it is important to understand the factors that drive the users’ engagement. In this paper we show how to define statistical models of dif- ferent complexity to describe patterns of song listening in an online music community. First, we adapt the LDA model to capture music taste from listening activities across users and identify both the groups of songs associated with the specific taste and the groups of listeners who share the same taste. Second, we define a graphical model that takes into account listening sessions and captures the listening moods of users in the community. Our session model leads to groups of songs and groups of listeners with similar behavior across listening sessions and enables faster inference when compared to the LDA model. Our experiments with the data from an on- line media site demonstrate that the session model is better in terms of the perplexity compared to two other models: the LDA-based taste model that does not incorporate cross- session information and a baseline model that does not use latent groupings of songs.},

@article{Adamopoulos2011,
abstract = {To date, the vast majority of recommender systems research has addressed the problem of recommending individual items $\backslash$nthat the user will like. Recommending collections of items rather than individual items is an important open space of research in the recommender systems community. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for describing and evaluating collections of items. This framework is designed to be domain independent and applicable to any collection recommendation problem. Our framework includes a categorization scheme for describing collections and a list $\backslash$nof features upon which a collection can be evaluated. We present a number of examples that showed how these different attribute and evaluation techniques can be combined and applied in a given domain. We then discuss issues relevant to the building of these systems. This includes challenges in obtaining data about users’ preferences for collections. We propose methods that include obtaining and analyzing existing collections from websites and developing multi-player online games to generate data about replacements and preferences. In addition, we look at how collection recommenders could be used to assist users either by creating collections from scratch or by assisting users in their own collection creation tasks. We believe this framing of an important problem will lead to new research in the development and evaluation of algorithms for recommending collections in interesting applications and with cross-domain applicability.},

abstract = {This empirical study investigates the contribution of different types of predictors to the purchasing behaviour at an online store. We use logit modelling to predict whether or not a purchase is made during the next visit to the website using both forward and backward variable-selection techniques, as well as Furnival and Wilson's global score search algorithm to find the best subset of predictors. We contribute to the literature by using variables from four different categories in predicting online-purchasing behaviour: (1) general clickstream behaviour at the level of the visit, (2) more detailed clickstream information, (3) customer demographics, and (4) historical purchase behaviour. The results show that predictors from all four categories are retained in the final (best subset) solution indicating that clickstream behaviour is important when determining the tendency to buy. We clearly indicate the contribution in predictive power of variables that were never used before in online purchasing studies. Detailed clickstream variables are the most important ones in classifying customers according to their online purchase behaviour. Though our dataset is limited in size, we are able to highlight the advantage of e-commerce retailers of being able to capture an elaborate list of customer information. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Hastie2009,
abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

abstract = {A personalized product recommendation is an enabling mechanism to overcome information overload occurred when shopping in an Internet marketplace. Collaborative filtering has been known to be one of the most successful recommendation methods, but its application to e-commerce has exposed well-known limitations such as sparsity and scalability, which would lead to poor recommendations. This paper suggests a personalized recommendation methodology by which we are able to get further effectiveness and quality of recommendations when applied to an Internet shopping mall. The suggested methodology is based on a variety of data mining techniques such as web usage mining, decision tree induction, association rule mining and the product taxonomy. For the evaluation of the methodology, we implement a recommender system using intelligent agent and data warehousing technologies. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The recommender system implements both collaborative and content-based techniques, suitable tailored to the specific requirements of an IPTV architecture, such as the limited screen definition, the reduced navigation capabilities, and the strict time constraints. The algorithms are extensively analyzed by means of off-line and on-line tests, showing the effectiveness of the recommender systems: up to 30\% of the recommendations are followed by a purchase, with an estimated lift factor (increase in sales) of 15\%.},

abstract = {Context-aware recommender systems (CARS) aim at im- proving user satisfaction to recommendations by tailoring these to each particular context. In this work we propose a contextual pre-ltering technique based on implicit user feedback. We introduce a new context-aware recommenda- tion approach called user micro-proling: The user prole is split into several sub-proles, each representing the user in a particular context. The predictions are done using these micro-proles instead of a single user model. However, the user taste depends on the exact partition of the contextual variable. The identication of a meaningful partition of the user prole and its evaluation is a non-trivial issue, especially when using implicit feedback and a contin- uous contextual variable. We propose an o -line evaluation procedure for CARS in these conditions and evaluate our approach on a time-aware music recommendation sytem.},

@article{Kulkarni2011,
abstract = {Web search is strongly influenced by time. The queries people issue change over time, with some queries occasionally spiking in popularity (e.g., earthquake) and others remaining relatively constant (e.g., youtube). Likewise, the documents indexed by a search engine change, with some documents always being about a particular query (e.g., the Wikipedia page on earthquakes is about the query earthquake) and others being about the query only at a particular point in time (e.g., the New York Times is only about earthquakes following a major seismic activity). The relationship between documents and queries can also change as people’s intent changes (e.g., people sought different content for the query earthquake before the Haitian earthquake than they did after). In this paper, we explore how queries, their associated documents, and the query intent change over the course of 10 weeks by analyzing query log data, a daily Web crawl, and periodic human relevance judgments. We identify several interesting features by which changes to query popularity can be classified, and show that presence of these features, when accompanied by changes in result content, can be a good indicator of},

abstract = {The exhaustivity of document descriptions and the specificity of index terms are usually regarded as independent. It is suggested that specificity should be interpreted statistically, as a function of term use rather than of term meaning. The effects on retrieval of variations in term specificity are examined, experiments with three test collections showing, in particular, that frequently-occurring terms are required for good overall performance. It is argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that matches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matches on frequent terms. Results for the test collections show that considerable improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure.},

abstract = {Music is inherently expressive of affective meaning and non- descriptive queries of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) system can show the emotion of users. In this paper, we consider the implicit emotional association between users and music to enrich MIR. We try to understand the latent emotional intent of queries via machine learning based emo- tion classification and compare the performance of emotion detection approaches on different feature sets. The experi- mental results conducted on 25 distinctive queries and 2257 songs show that our approach can be a significant explo- ration in processing non-descriptive music retrieval queries with interactive tags and rich lyrics.},

abstract = {Recommender systems in TV applications mostly focus on the recommendation of video-on-demand (VOD) content, although the major part of users’ content consumption is realized on linear channel programs (live or recorded), termed EPG programs. The accurate collab- orative filtering algorithms suitable for VOD recommendation cannot be directly carried over for EPG program recommendation. First, EPG pro- gram recommendation features the cold start problem; a significant part of EPG programs are new in the system. Second, and more importantly, without explicit user feedbacks (ratings) the algorithms have to model user preference based on the noisy and less directly interpretable implicit user feedbacks. In this paper, we present several approaches that over- come these difficulties, by applying pre-filtering on noisy low-level data and taking into account channel preferences of users and program meta- data if available to cope with the cold start. Using time-dependent tensor factorization approaches, the temporal preferences of users are also re- flected in recommendation, that also hints on the person watching the TV. Experiments were performed on a dataset of SaskTel, a Canadian IPTV service provider using Microsoft Mediaroom middleware.},

These extensions include, among others, an improvement of understanding of users and items, incorporation of the contextual information into the recommendation process, support for multicriteria ratings, and a provision of more flexible and less intrusive types of recommendations.},

@article{Barlow1989,
abstract = {What use can the brain make of the massive flow of sensory information that occurs without any associated rewards or punishments? This question is reviewed in the light of connectionist models of unsupervised learning and some older ideas, namely the cognitive maps and working models of Tolman and Craik, and the idea that redundancy is important for understanding perception (Attneave 1954), the physiology of sensory pathways (Barlow 1959), and pattern recognition (Watanabe 1960). It is argued that (1) The redundancy of sensory messages provides the knowledge incorporated in the maps or models. (2) Some of this knowledge can be obtained by observations of mean, variance, and covariance of sensory messages, and perhaps also by a method called “minimum entropy coding.” (3) Such knowledge may be incorporated in a model of “what usually happens” with which incoming messages are automatically compared, enabling unexpected discrepancies to be immediately identified. (4) Knowledge of the sort incorporated into such a filter is a necessary prerequisite of ordinary learning, and a representation whose elements are independent makes it possible to form associations with logical functions of the elements, not just with the elements themselves.},

abstract = {The relationship between mood and creativity has been widely studied in psychology, however, no conclusion is reached in terms of which mood triggers high creativity, positive or negative. This paper provides new insights to this on-going argument by examining the relationship be- tween lyrics creativity and music mood. We use three com- putational measures to gauge lyrics creativity: Type-to- Token Ratio, word norms fraction, and WordNet similarity. We then test three hypotheses regarding differences in lyr- ics creativity between music with different moods on 2715 U.S. rock songs. The three measures led to consistent find- ings that lyrics of negative and sad songs demonstrate high- er linguistic creativity than those of positive and happy songs. Our findings support previous studies in psycholin- guistics that people write more creatively when the text conveys sad or negative sentiment, and contradict previous research that positive mood triggers more unusual word as- sociations. The result also indicates that different measures capture different aspects of lyrics creativity.},

@article{Blanco-Fernandez2008,
abstract = {Recommender systems arose in view of the information overload present in numerous domains. The so-called content-based recommenders offer products similar to those the users liked in the past. However, due to the use of syntactic similarity metrics, these systems elaborate overspecialized recommendations including products very similar to those the user already knows. In this paper, we present a strategy that overcomes overspecialization by applying semantic reasoning techniques. Thanks to the reasoning, our strategy discovers huge amounts of knowledge about the user's preferences, and compares them with available products in a more flexible way, beyond the conventional syntactic metrics. The resulting reasoning-based strategy has been experimentally evaluated in the digital TV domain. Our results show: (i) enhanced personalized recommendations, (ii) computational viability, and (iii) much greater accuracy.},

@article{Laurier2011,
abstract = {Digital music is becoming a major part of the user experience with computers and mobile devices. Automatically organizing this content is a huge challenge. In this work, we focus on automatically classifying music by mood. For this purpose, we propose computational models using information extracted from the audio signal. The foundations of such algorithms are based on techniques from the fields of signal processing, machine learning and information retrieval. First, by studying the tagging behavior of a music social network with dimensionality reduction techniques, we find a representation model for mood in music. We believe that this methodology can be applied to other domains as well. Then, we propose a method for automatic music mood classification and detail the results for different types of classifiers. We analyze the contributions of audio descriptors and how their values are related to the observed mood, trying to find explanation from psychology and musicology. We also propose a multimodal version of our algorithm using lyrics information, contributing to the field of text retrieval with a new model based on key words differentiating categories. Moreover, after showing the relation between mood and genre, we present a new approach using automatic music genre classification. We demonstrate that genre-based mood classifiers give higher accuracies than standard audio models. Finally, we propose a rule extraction technique to explicit the strategy behind our models. This method allows us to make sense of the classifiers and to understand how they can predict the musical mood. All the proposed algorithms are evaluated with user data. Our audio based approaches, adapted to the context, have been evaluated in international evaluation campaigns.},

With the increasing offer of TV content, there is an emer- gent need for personalised recommendation solutions, which help users to select programs of interest. In this work, we study the watching patterns of users of an Australian nation- wide catch-up TV service provider and develop a suite of approaches for a catch-up recommendation scenario. We evaluate these approaches using a new large-scale dataset gathered by theWeb-based catch-up portal deployed by the provider. The evaluation allows us to compare the perfor- mance of several recommenders that address the discovery of both TV programs already watched by users and new programs that users may find relevant.},

Most research up to this point has focused on improving the accuracy of recommender systems. We believe that not only has this narrow focus been misguided, but has even been detrimental to the field. The recommendations that are most accurate according to the standard metrics are sometimes not the recommendations that are most useful to users. In this paper, we propose informal arguments that the recommender community should move beyond the conventional accuracy metrics and their associated experimental methodologies. We propose new user-centric directions for evaluating recommender systems.},

A changing context can induce changes in the target concepts, producing what is known as concept drift. We describe a family of learning algorithms that flexibly react to concept drift and can take advantage of situations where contexts reappear. The general approach underlying all these algorithms consists of (1) keeping only a window of currently trusted examples and hypotheses; (2) storing concept descriptions and re-using them when a previous context re-appears; and (3) controlling both of these functions by a heuristic that constantly monitors the system's behavior. The paper reports on experiments that test the systems' performance under various conditions such as different levels of noise and different extent and rate of concept drift.},

Our genre classification differs from current methods used for TV programs in that it does not require the use of an electronic program guide, such as in personal video recorders. Electronic program guides use simple text based information about genre for whole programs. In contrast, we can determine genre information at the level of program segments. This can be important, for example, for TV program rating which allows to deal selectively with program sections. We demonstrate our method on a set of 7 different TV news and talk shows. The experimental results show that the audio patterns for news and talk show that are consistent with the general structure of these programs},

abstract = {Factor-analytic evidence has led most psychologists to describe affect as a set of dimensions, such as displeasure, distress, depression, excitement, and so on, with each dimension varying independently of the others. However, there is other evidence that rather than being independent, these affective dimensions are interrelated in a highly systematic fashion. The evidence suggests that these interrelationships can be represented by a spatial model in which affective concepts fall in a circle in the following order: pleasure (0), excitement (45), arousal (90), distress (135), displeasure (180), depression (225), sleepiness (270), and relaxation (315). This model was offered both as a way psychologists can represent the structure of affective experience, as assessed through self-report, and as a representation of the cognitive structure that laymen utilize in conceptualizing affect. Supportive evidence was obtained by scaling 28 emotion-denoting adjectives in 4 different ways: R. T. Ross's (1938) technique for a circular ordering of variables, a multidimensional scaling procedure based on perceived similarity among the terms, a unidimensional scaling on hypothesized pleasure–displeasure and degree-of-arousal dimensions, and a principal-components analysis of 343 Ss' self-reports of their current affective states.

We illustrate our approach on data obtained from a module (Today Module) published regularly on Yahoo! Front Page and demonstrate significant improvement over commonly used baseline methods.

In this paper we show how the concept of relevance may be replaced by the condition of being highly rated by a similarity measure. Thus it becomes possible to identify the stop words in a cullectmn by automated statistical testing. We describe the nature of the statistical test as it is realized with a vector retrieval methodology based on the cosine coefficient of document-document similarity. As an example, this tech nique is then applied to a large MEDLINE " subset in the area of biotechnology. The initial processing of this datahase involves a 310 word stop list of common non-content terms. Our technique is then applied and 75\% of the remaining terms are identified as stop words. We compare retrieval with and without the removal of these stop words and find that of the top twenty documents retrieved in response to a random query document. seventeen of these are the same on the average for the two methods We also examine the differences and conclude that where the user prefers one method over the other, the new method with the reduced term set is favored about three times out of four.},

abstract = {Typical recommender systems adopt a static view of the recommendation$\backslash$nprocess and treat it as a prediction problem. We argue that it is$\backslash$nmore appropriate to view the problem of generating recommendations$\backslash$nas a sequential optimization problem and, consequently, that Markov$\backslash$ndecision processes (MDPs) provide a more appropriate model for recommender$\backslash$nsystems. MDPs introduce two benefits: they take into account the$\backslash$nlong-term effects of each recommendation and the expected value of$\backslash$neach recommendation. To succeed in practice, an MDP-based recommender$\backslash$nsystem must employ a strong initial model, must be solvable quickly,$\backslash$nand should not consume too much memory. In this paper, we describe$\backslash$nour particular MDP model, its initialization using a predictive model,$\backslash$nthe solution and update algorithm, and its actual performance on$\backslash$na commercial site. We also describe the particular predictive model$\backslash$nwe used which outperforms previous models. Our system is one of a$\backslash$nsmall number of commercially deployed recommender systems. As far$\backslash$nas we know, it is the first to report experimental analysis conducted$\backslash$non a real commercial site. These results validate the commercial$\backslash$nvalue of recommender systems, and in particular, of our MDP-based$\backslash$napproach.},

abstract = {A new edition of the classic, groundbreaking book on robust statistics Over twenty-five years after the publication of its predecessor, Robust Statistics, Second Edition continues to provide an authoritative and systematic treatment of the topic. This new edition has been thoroughly updated and expanded to reflect the latest advances in the field while also outlining the established theory and applications for building a solid foundation in robust statistics for both the theoretical and the applied statistician. A comprehensive introduction and discussion on the formal mathematical background behind qualitative and quantitative robustness is provided, and subsequent chapters delve into basic types of scale estimates, asymptotic minimax theory, regression, robust covariance, and robust design. In addition to an extended treatment of robust regression, the Second Edition features four new chapters covering: Robust Tests Small Sample Asymptotics Breakdown Point Bayesian Robustness An expanded treatment of robust regression and pseudo-values is also featured, and concepts, rather than mathematical completeness, are stressed in every discussion. Selected numerical algorithms for computing robust estimates and convergence proofs are provided throughout the book, along with quantitative robustness information for a variety of estimates. A General Remarks section appears at the beginning of each chapter and provides readers with ample motivation for working with the presented methods and techniques. Robust Statistics, Second Edition is an ideal book for graduate-level courses on the topic. It also serves as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners who wish to study the statistical research associated with robust statistics.},

@phdthesis{Celma2008,
abstract = {Music consumption is biased towards a few popular artists. For instance, in 2007 only 1\% of all digital tracks accounted for 80\% of all sales. Similarly, 1,000 albums accounted for 50\% of all album sales, and 80\% of all albums sold were purchased less than 100 times. There is a need to assist people to filter, discover, personalise and recommend from the huge amount of music content available along the Long Tail. Current music recommendation algorithms try to accurately predict what people demand to listen to. However, quite often these algorithms tend to recommend popular -or well-known to the user- music, decreasing the effectiveness of the recommendations. These approaches focus on improving the accuracy of the recommendations. That is, try to make accurate predictions about what a user could listen to, or buy next, independently of how useful to the user could be the provided recommendations. In this Thesis we stress the importance of the user's perceived quality of the recommendations. We model the Long Tail curve of artist popularity to predict -potentially- interesting and unknown music, hidden in the tail of the popularity curve. Effective recommendation systems should promote novel and relevant material (non-obvious recommendations), taken primarily from the tail of a popularity distribution. The main contributions of this Thesis are: (i) a novel network-based approach for recommender systems, based on the analysis of the item (or user) similarity graph, and the popularity of the items, (ii) a user-centric evaluation that measures the user's relevance and novelty of the recommendations, and (iii) two prototype systems that implement the ideas derived from the theoretical work. Our findings have significant implications for recommender systems that assist users to explore the Long Tail, digging for content they might like.},

@phdthesis{Gaengler2011,
abstract = {Music is perceived and described very subjectively by every individual. Nowadays, people often get lost in their steadily growing, multi-placed, digital music collection. Existing music player and management applications get in trouble when dealing with poor metadata that is predominant in personal music collections. There are several music information services available that assist users by providing tools for precisely organising their music collection, or for presenting them new insights into their own music library and listening habits. However, it is still not the case that music consumers can seamlessly interact with all these auxiliary services directly from the place where they access their music individually. To profit from the manifold music and music-related knowledge that is or can be available via various information services, this information has to be gathered up, semantically federated, and integrated into a uniform knowledge base that can personalised represent this data in an appropriate visualisation to the users. This personalised semantic aggregation of music metadata from several sources is the gist of this thesis. The outlined solution particularly concentrates on users’ needs regarding music collection management which can strongly alternate between single human beings. The author’s proposal, the personal music knowledge base (PMKB), consists of a client-server architecture with uniform communication endpoints and an ontological knowledge representation model format that is able to represent the versatile information of its use cases. The PMKB concept is appropriate to cover the complete information flow life cycle, including the processes of user account initialisation, information service choice, individual information extraction, and proactive update notification. The PMKB implementation makes use of SemanticWeb technologies. Particularly the knowledge representation part of the PMKB vision is explained in this work. Several new Semantic Web ontologies are defined or existing ones are massively modified to meet the requirements of a personalised semantic federation of music and music-related data for managing personal music collections. The outcome is, amongst others, • a new vocabulary for describing the play back domain, • another one for representing information service categorisations and quality ratings, and • one that unites the beneficial parts of the existing advanced user modelling ontologies. The introduced vocabularies can be perfectly utilised in conjunction with the existing Music Ontology framework. Some RDFizers that also make use of the outlined ontologies in their mapping definitions, illustrate the fitness in practise of these specifications. A social evaluation method is applied to carry out an examination dealing with the reutilisation, application and feedback of the vocabularies that are explained in this work. This analysis shows that it is a good practise to properly publish Semantic Web ontologies with the help of some Linked Data principles and further basic SEO techniques to easily reach the searching audience, to avoid duplicates of such KR specifications, and, last but not least, to directly establish a "shared understanding". Due to their project-independence, the proposed vocabularies can be deployed in every knowledge representation model that needs their knowledge representation capacities. This thesis added its value to make the vision of a personal music knowledge base come true.},

abstract = {In order to build relevant, useful, and effective recommender systems, researchers need to understand why users come to these systems and how users judge recommendation lists. Today, researchers use accuracy-based metrics for judging goodness. Yet these metrics cannot capture users’ criteria for judging recommendation usefulness. We need to rethink recommenders from a user’s perspective: they help users find new information. Thus, not only do we need to know about the user, we need to know what the user is looking for. In this dissertation, we explore how to tailor recommendation lists not just to a user, but to the user’s current information seeking task. We argue that each recommender algorithm has specific strengths and weaknesses, different from other algorithms. Thus, different recommender algorithms are better suited for specific users and their information seeking tasks. A recommender system should, then, select and tune the appropriate recommender algorithm (or algorithms) for a given user/information seeking task combination. To support this, we present results in three areas. First, we apply recommender systems in the domain of peer-reviewed computer science research papers, a domain where users have external criteria for selecting items to consume. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through several sets of experiments. Second, we argue that current recommender systems research in not focused on user needs, but rather on algorithm design and performance. To bring users back into focus, we reflect on how users perceive recommenders and the recommendation process, and present Human-Recommender Interaction theory, a framework and language for describing recommenders and the recommendation lists they generate. Third, we look to different ways of evaluating recommender systems algorithms. To this end, we propose a new set of recommender metrics, run experiments on several recommender algorithms using these metrics, and categorize the differences we discovered. Through Human-Recommender Interaction and these new metrics, we can bridge users and their needs with recommender algorithms to generate more useful recommendation lists.},

abstract = {Personalised recommender systems aim to help users access and retrieve relevant information or items from large collections, by automatically finding and suggesting products or services of likely interest based on observed evidence of the users‟ preferences. For many reasons, user preferences are difficult to guess, and therefore re- commender systems have a considerable variance in their success ratio in estimating the user‟s tastes and interests. In such a scenario, self-predicting the chances that a recommendation is accurate before actually submitting it to a user becomes an interesting capability from many perspectives. Performance prediction has been studied in the context of search engines in the Information Retrieval field, but there is little if any prior research of this problem in the recommendation domain. This thesis investigates the definition and formalisation of performance prediction methods for recommender systems. Specifically, we study adaptations of search performance predictors from the Information Retrieval field, and propose new predictors based on theories and models from Information Theory and Social Graph Theory. We show the instantiation of information-theoretical performance prediction methods on both rating and access log data, and the application of social-based predictors to social network structures. Recommendation performance prediction is a relevant problem per se, because of its potential application to many uses. Thus, we primarily evaluate the quality of the proposed solutions in terms of the correlation between the predicted and the observed performance on test data. This assessment requires a clear recommender evaluation methodology against which the predictions can be contrasted. Given that the evaluation of recommender systems is an open area to a significant extent, the thesis addresses the evaluation methodology as a part of the researched problem. We analyse how the variations in the evaluation procedure may alter the apparent behaviour of performance predictors, and we propose approaches to avoid misleading observations. In addition to the stand-alone assessment of the proposed predictors, we re- search the use of the predictive capability in the context of one of its common applications, namely the dynamic adjustment of recommendation methods and components. We research approaches where the combination leans towards the algorithm or the component that is predicted to perform best in each case, aiming to enhance the performance of the resulting dynamic configuration. The thesis reports positive empirical evidence confirming both a significant predictive power for the proposed methods in different experiments, and consistent improvements in the performance of dynamic recommenders employing the proposed predictors.},

abstract = {Bayes’ theorem is the cornerstone of statistical inference. It provides the tools for dealing with knowledge in an uncertain world, allowing us to explain observed phenomena through the refinement of belief in model parameters. At the heart of this elegant framework lie intractable integrals, whether in computing an average over some posterior distribution, or in determining the normalizing constant of a distribution. This thesis examines both deterministic and stochastic methods in which these integrals can be treated. Of particular interest shall be para- metric models where the parameter space can be extended with additional latent variables to get distributions that are easier to handle algorithmically. Deterministic methods approximate the posterior distribution with a simpler distribution over which the required integrals become tractable. We derive and examine a new generic $\alpha$-divergence message passing scheme for a multivariate mixture of Gaussians, a particular modeling problem requiring latent variables. This algorithm minimizes local $\alpha$-divergences over a chosen posterior factorization, and includes variational Bayes and expectation propagation as special cases. Stochastic (or Monte Carlo) methods rely on a sample from the posterior to simplify the integration tasks, giving exact estimates in the limit of an infinite sample. Parallel tempering and thermodynamic integration are introduced as ‘gold standard’ methods to sample from multimodal posterior distributions and determine normalizing constants. A parallel tempered approach to sampling from a mixture of Gaussians posterior through Gibbs sampling is de- rived, and novel methods are introduced to improve the numerical stability of thermodynamic integration. A full comparison with parallel tempering and thermodynamic integration shows variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and message passing with the Hellinger distance $\alpha$ = 1 bution with high accuracy. Variational and stochastic methods are combined in a novel way to design Markov chain 2 to be perfectly suitable for model selection, and for approximating the predictive distribution with high accuracy. Variational and stochastic methods are combined in a novel way to design Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) transition densities, giving a variational transition kernel, which lower bounds an exact transition kernel. We highlight the general need to mix variational methods with other MCMC moves, by proving that the variational kernel does not necessarily give a geometrically ergodic chain.},

abstract = {The ever-increasing volume and complexity of information flowing into our daily lives challenge the limits of human processing capabilities in a wide array of information seeking and e-commerce activities. In this context, users need help to cope with this wealth of information, in order to reach the most interesting products, while still getting novelty, surprise and relevance. Recommender systems suggest users products or services they may be interested in, by taking into account or predicting their tastes, priorities or goals. For that purpose, user profiles or usage data are compared with some reference characteristics, which may belong to the information objects (content-based approach), or to other users in the same environment (collaborative filtering approach). Inspired by Information Retrieval and Machine Learning techniques, both approaches are based on statistical or heuristic models that attempt to capture the correlations between users and objects. Commercial applications like Amazon online store (www.amazon.com), Google News (news.google.com) or YouTube (www.youtube.com), are examples of significant success stories of recommendation techniques. However, several limitations of the current recommender systems remain, such as the sparsity of user preference and item content feature spaces, the difficulty of recommending items to users with few preferences declared, or the lack of flexibility to incorporate contextual factors into the recommendation processes. Some of these limitations can be related to a limited understanding and exploitation of the semantics underlying both user profiles and item descriptions. In this respect, an enhancement of the semantic knowledge, and its representation, describing interests and contents can be envisioned as a potential direction to deal with those limitations. This thesis explores the development of an ontology-based knowledge model to link the (explicit and implicit) meanings involved in user interests and resource contents. Upon this knowledge representation, several content-based and collaborative recommendation models are proposed and evaluated. The models have been integrated in a prototype, in which they are empirically tested with real users. The prototype is designed as an open, flexible evaluation platform of further use in addressing open research problems in the area of recommender systems.},

abstract = {The first chapter of this dissertation studies optimal pricing in the presence of recommender systems. A recommender system is a program that internet sellers employ to infer what product a returning customer would like using data on the feedback from all customers' past purchases. Its effect on the market is twofold: (i) it creates value by reducing product uncertainty for the customers and hence (ii) its recommendations can be offered as add-ons, which generates informational externalities as the quality of the recommendation add-on is endogenously determined by sales. The chapter investigates the impact of these factors on optimal pricing of different products for a seller with a recommender systems in the presence of a competitive fringe without such a system. The main finding is that, if the recommender system is sufficiently effective in reducing uncertainty, the seller prices otherwise symmetric products differently to have some products experienced more aggressively. The second chapter analyzes an information transmission problem between multiple parties. An exogenously informed party tries to convey his information to two uninformed audiences, who react to the same news in opposite ways. In this setting, satisfying one audience might come at the expense of upsetting the other. The chapter focuses on this dilemma to provide insights into why information is shared privately behind closed doors in some cases and is made public in others. The third chapter studies the problem of a monopolist selling a durable good over time. The model deviates from the standard dynamic monopoly models by assuming that the monopolist can vary the quality of the product each period and that the buyers are differentiated with respect to their valuation of quality. In this setting, the chapter investigates to what degree the Coase conjecture applied, given that the buys who are willing to wait for low prices know that low prices will possibly come with low quality. The finding is that despite of this low quality threat, the seller still gets zero profits at the limit.},

They allow users to annotate arbitrary resources with freely chosen keywords, so called tags. The tags are used for navigation, finding resources, and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for the user. The conceptual structure underlying collaborative tagging systems is called folksonomy. In this thesis a new data mining task – the mining of all frequent tri-concepts – is presented, together with an efficient algorithm for discovering such implicit shared conceptualizations. Collaborative tagging systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource. We compare several recommendation algorithms on large-scale real-world datasets: an adaptation of user-based Collaborative Filtering, a graph-based recommender, and simpler methods based on tag co-occurences. The social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy, which is currently among the three most popular systems of its kind, has been developed by our research group.

abstract = {Computer agent technology is a useful technology for a customer to deal with information overload and search complexity in ecommerce. This study focus on how a product-brokering recommendation agent (RA) can be designed better so that a customer will be more likely to trust and then adopt the RA for the customer's purchase decision making. Our research model predicts that internalization and familiarity will increase both cognitive trust and emotional trust in an RA, which will then increase a customer's intention to adopt the RA either as a delegated agent or as a decision aid. Internalization refers to a customer's perception of how well an RA represents the customer's real needs. A customer's familiarity with an RA is expected to increase from the initial interaction through repeated interactions. We conducted a lab experiment to test the model. We also used a process- tracing method to track the processes of trust formation. The results of the quantitative analysis (PLS analysis) support our hypotheses. (1) Internalization significantly increases a customer's intention to adopt an RA via increased cognitive trust and emotional trust. This implies that an RA should make sure a customer's specifications of product attributes (i.e. the expressed needs) actually represent the customer's real needs instead just taking a customer's specifications as they are, and that the focus of RA design should shift from product filtering toward customer representation. (2) This study shows that RA adoption is not purely rational or cognitive. RA adoption is affected by both cognitive trust and emotional trust. Emotional trust in an RA directly increases a customer's intention to adopt an RA, and emotional trust fully mediates the impact of cognitive trust on the intention to adopt an RA. The effect of emotional trust on the intention to adopt an RA as a delegated agent is higher than its impact on the intention to adopt an RA as a decision aid, while the effect of cognitive trust on the intention to adopt an RA as a delegated agent is lower than its effect on the intention to adopt an RA as a decision aid. This implies that emotional trust should be investigated in IT adoption and trust research. (3) The intention to adopt an RA as a delegated agent and the intention to adopt an RA as a decision aid are different levels of RA adoption that merit separate research. They are different at the conceptual, measurement, and behavioral levels. (4) The total effects of familiarity on the intention to adopt an RA are low, indicating that a customer decides on RA adoption mainly during her initial interaction with an RA. In addition, we used a process-tracing method to track how customer trust/distrust in an RA is formed. To our best knowledge, this is the first empirical study to trace the processes of trust/distrust formation. We developed two coding schemes in terms of: a) the source and the destination of a process, and b) trust/distrust formation via different ways that customers process their knowledge of an RA. The verbal protocols from 49 subjects, speaking 40 minutes per person on average, were collected. The results of the protocol analysis include: (1) Trust and distrust have different structures in terms of cognitive and emotional components. (2) Trust and distrust in an RA are formed via different ways that customers process their knowledge about an RA (3) An RA needs to be designed in different ways in order to facilitate cognitive and emotional trust while preventing cognitive and emotional distrust. (4) Repeated interactions change neither the structures of trust/distrust nor the proportion of different trust/distrust formation processes. However, the quantities of processes in all categories drop by almost 50\% from initial interactions to second interactions, and then reach a stable level. (5) The level of RA internalization change neither trust/distrust structures, nor the way that customers process their knowledge in order to form trust or distrust. (6) Finally, an RA needs to be designed in different ways in order to facilitate cognitive trust vs. emotional trust. Similarly, the RA needs to be designed in different ways in order to prevent cognitive distrust vs. emotional distrust.},

abstract = {The user-centric annotation of resources by freely chosen words (tags) has become the predominant form of content categorization of the Web 2.0 age. It provided the foundations for the success of now famous services, such as Delicious, Flickr, LibraryThing, or Last.fm. Tags have proven to be a powerful alternative to existing top-down categorization techniques, as for example taxonomies or predefined dictionaries, which lack flexibility and are expensive in their creation and maintenance. Instead, tagging allows users to choose the labels that match their real needs, tastes, or language, which reduces the required cognitive effort. Services that center on the collaborative tagging of resources are called folksonomies. These communities have become an invaluable source for information retrieval, since they bundle the interests of thousand or even millions of users, magnifying the underlying domain from a user-centric perspective. Furthermore, the existence of tags allows for the unified modeling of content independent of its type or format and without the need of expensive con- tent retrieval, processing, storage, or indexing. Of special interest from an information retrieval perspective are the tags that are generated in “broad folksonomies”, where many users reference and tag the same objects. This collaborative tagging produces high quality content descriptors and characteristic tag spectra with high potential for better content models. This dissertation aims to develop novel algorithms for the personalized recommendation of objects within folksonomies. Recommender systems sup- port users in the discovery of valuable content out of an overwhelming set of choices and already increase the perceived value of many web applications. However, the tripartite structure of folksonomies that results from the interaction of content, tags, and users goes beyond the capability of common recommendation techniques. The algorithms presented in this dissertation are instead especially tailored towards to needs of folksonomies. They incorporate tagging and usage patterns in parallel in order to derive more precise and robust recommendation models. Exhaustive tests for different settings and various folksonomies show that the developed solutions produce more accurate recommendations than the current state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Recommender systems using collaborative filtering are a popular technique for reducing information overload and finding products to purchase. However the economic model required to run a business around collaborative filtering is at odds with the end user’s de- sire for unvarnished recommendations. Traditional recommender systems are centralized and available only online which is at odds with the user’s desire to have recommendations wherever they are. A personal recommender system will someday empower people with the technology needed to assert their freedom to share information of all kinds, and to take recommendations with them, wherever they go. In this thesis we take three steps toward the long term vision of a personal recommender system. The PocketLens peer-to-peer collaborative filtering algorithm, the MultiLens recommendation framework, and MovieLens Unplugged. We present the PocketLens collaborative filtering algorithm along with four peer-to-peer architectures for finding neighbors. We evaluate the architectures and algorithms in a series of experiments. These experiments show that PocketLens can run on portable and disconnected devices, give users control of their data, and produce recommendations that are as good as the best published algorithms to date. We present the MultiLens framework. A new recommendation engine capable of combining multiple dimensions of preference and content information into a model used to make recommendations. We identify twelve application patterns used by recommender applications, and show how the MultiLens framework can be used to implement these patterns. We experimentally evaluate the ability of MultiLens to combine a content dimension with a quality dimension to solve the first rater and sparsity problems in collaborative filtering. We present MovieLens unplugged, which examines several important challenges that interface designers must overcome on mobile devices: Providing sufficient value to attract prospective wireless users, handling occasionally connected devices, privacy and security, and surmounting the physical limitations of the devices. We present our experience with the implementation of a wireless movie recommender system on a cell phone browser, an AvantGo channel, a wireless PDA, and a voice-only phone interface. These interfaces help MovieLens users select movies to rent, buy, or see while away from their computer.},

abstract = {The goal of information filtering systems (IF systems) is to support users in finding relevant information from a dynamic base of data objects. IF systems base their relevance computations on so-called user profiles in which they maintain representations of the users’ interests. Whenever users’ interests change, user profiles become inaccurate and the prediction quality decreases. The more dynamic user interests are, the more important it is for IF systems to up- date user profiles rapidly to shorten this period of decreased prediction quality. A survey of existing systems, however, shows that they typically provide support only for selected types of interest changes, namely either for gradual or for abrupt interest changes. The objective of this dissertation is to design an information filtering architecture capable of dealing with frequently changing user interests. To make profile updating more efficient, our QuerySet filtering architecture (QSA) uses user profiles of a modular structure. QSA profiles primarily consist of a set of queries that are each expected to have a high correspondence with one of the user’s interests. Interest changes affecting only a subset of the user’s interests can then be handled efficiently by updating only the queries representing the affected interests. Complementing the queries, QSA profiles contain an aggregation function that aggregates the ratings that the individual queries assign to an object. This resulting rating is used to rank filtered objects. The aggregation function allows for especially efficient profile updating when- ever the relative relevance of individual queries changes. To allow handling both gradual and abrupt interest changes, QSA profiles are provided with two distinct profile updating mechanisms. First, QSA systems can track gradual interest changes by learning from relevance feedback. Second, user-aggregated relevance feedback (URF) provides users with direct access to the aggregation function and allows them to manually handle major profile inaccuracies, as they occur during profile initialization and after major interest changes. URF is a rating that users assign not to a single object, but to a set of objects and that seamlessly integrates with relevance feedback in the profile updating process. We present a framework of specialized user interface families that allow entering URF. The individual interfaces are optimized for three different purposes, i.e. simplest learnability (form-based interfaces), maximum accuracy (histogram-based interfaces), and maximum efficiency (paintable interfaces). We present an experimental evaluation of the interfaces. We demonstrate the QuerySet Architecture at the example of our TV program recommendation system TV Scout. The system contains multiple subsystems using different content-based and collaborative filtering techniques and allows users to combine these techniques in their profiles. Additional subsystems can be plugged in at any time to “assimilate” more query functionality. The TV Scout is currently in commercial, Internet-wide use. While the Query- Set Architecture proved very successful in the TV application area, we believe that it will prove equally useful for a number of other highly dynamic application areas, such as, for ex- ample, news, web pages, and Internet auctions.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering is regarded as one of the most promising approaches in recommender systems. To date, it is best known for its use on e-commerce web sites. It has also been widely used in other areas, for example, filtering Usenet News, recommending TV shows and web personalization. However, a survey of existing algorithms shows there remain some fundamental research questions in overcoming some challenges for collaborative filtering system. These questions influence the prevalence of the recommendation systems to a great extent. • Scalability: A large online retailer might have huge amounts of data, tens of millions of customers and millions of distinct catalogue items. These “long user rows” slow down the performance of the recommender system, further reducing scalability. • Accuracy: Accuracy of collaborative filtering considers the problem of how the system would successfully measure the similarity between users (in user-based approaches) or items (in item-based approaches) in order to discover the intrinsic properties that exist amongst users and/or amongst item. Users need recommendations of high quality and they can trust to help them. • Robustness: Robustness of collaborative filtering systems is defined as the ability to provide accurate predictions given some degree of noise in the data. • Sparsity: It refers to the fact that most users do not rate many items and hence the user-item rating matrix is very sparse and insufficient to identify similarities in consumer interests. In many commercial recommender systems, even active users may have purchased less than 1\% of the items, (1\% of 2 million books is 20,000 books). As a result, the accuracy of recommendations may be poor. • Cold Start: It has been used to describe the situation when almost nothing is known about the new users or new items. This dissertation focuses on effectiveness and efficiency of collaborative filtering technologies. We proposed a novel collaborative filtering framework which is capable of dealing with an immense and dynamic dataset effectively and efficiently. Specifically, we improved the existing algorithms from the following aspects: 1. Generic Model: Integrate the content-based filtering and collaborative filtering by unifying the external attributes of users and items with rating information in a generic model. 2. Effectiveness: 1)Propose a new method of computing similarity in collaborative filtering to better reflect the reality. 2)Consider the interest drift in collaborative filtering. We introduce the time recency to tackle it. 3. Efficiency: Propose a number of solutions towards traditional item-based and user-based collaborative filtering which can handle a large scale of data in the dynamical environment. The experiments have shown that our proposed framework can substantially improve the performance of traditional collaborative filtering algorithms. The main contributions of this dissertation include: demonstrating a generic model, improving the accuracy of collaborative filtering through the new similarity computation and addressing interest drift in the traditional collaborative filtering and providing a highly efficient incremental framework which can be easily used for the online applications and an effective indexing which can reduce the time complexity of the traditional algorithms dramatically.},

abstract = {Context-aware ranking is an important task with many applications like recommender systems or search engines. E.g. in recommender systems items (products, movies, . . . ) and for search engines webpages should be ranked. In all these applications, the ranking is not global (i.e. always the same) but depends on the context. Simple examples for context are the user for recommender systems and the query for search engines. More complicated context includes time, last actions, etc. In all of these settings, the variables (e.g. customer, product) are deﬁned over large categorical domains and the observations are combinations of the variables (e.g. a user buys a product). The major problem is that typically the observations are very sparse and only positive events are observed. In this work, we develop a theory of context-aware ranking and methods for solving this task. Our theory brings together tasks like item recommendation and tag recommendation that have been studied mostly isolated before. We ﬁrst investigate the general problem setting and show how pairwise ranking constraints can be inferred from observations. Then, we develop Bayesian Context-aware Ranking (BCR) which consists of a generic optimization and learning method. BCR is both generic in terms of models and the type of context. The optimization criterion BCR-Opt is the MAP estimator of a parametrized model using the inferred ranking constraints. BCR-Learn is a learning algorithm that maximizes BCR-Opt and is based on stochastic gradient descent with bootstrap sampling of cases. As the variables are de- ﬁned over a categorical domain, we propose to use factorization models for parametrizing the dependencies between variable instances. The Tucker decomposition (TD) is a general linear factorization model subsuming parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). We discuss the problems of TD in terms of runtime complexity for multi-mode problems and show that PARAFAC solves this issue. We show that for our tasks both TD and PARAFAC empirically have bad performance either in runtime or quality, and thus we develop the PITF approach (a special case of PARAFAC) that models pairwise interactions explicitly. In a second part, we apply our theory of context-aware ranking with factorization models to the tasks of item recommendation, tag recommendation and sequential-set recommendation. For item recommendation and tag recommendation we apply the PITF model with BCR optimization directly. For sequential-set recommendation, we extend the Markov chain model by personalization, i.e. each user can have an own transition graph. As this setting is highly sparse, we model the transition cube with the PITF factorization and show that our factorized, personalized Markov chain subsumes both the common matrix factorization model and a factorized standard (non-personalized) Markov chain. In each of the tasks, we conduct a detailed empirically study and show that our approaches outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, for the task of graph-based tag recommendation our approach won the 2009 ECML/PKDD Discovery Challenge. Furthermore, two extensions are studied. First, a non-parametric method for generating time-variant factor models is developed. Here, each factor is decomposed into free parameters and a set of basis functions that are generated from the data using a kernel assumption. Finally, the binary maximum margin matrix factorization classiﬁer is extended to settings where only one class is observed.},

abstract = {Automated recommender systems make product suggestions that are tailored to the human user’s individual needs and represent powerful means to combat information glut. However, their practical applicability has been largely con- fined to scenarios where all information relevant for recommendation making is kept in one single, authoritative node. Recently, novel distributed infrastructures are emerging, e.g., peer-to-peer and ad-hoc networks, the Semantic Web, the Grid, etc., and supersede classical client/server approaches in many respects. These infrastructures could like- wise benefit from recommender system services, leading to a paradigm shift towards decentralized recommender systems. In this thesis, we investigate the challenges that decentralized recommender systems bring up and propose diverse techniques in order to cope with those particular issues. The spectrum of methods proposed ranges from the employment of product classification taxonomies as powerful background knowledge, alleviating the sparsity problem, to trust propagation mechanisms designed to address the scalability issue. Empirical investigations on the correlation of interpersonal trust and interest similarity provide the component glue that melds these results together and renders the eventual creation of a decentralized recommender framework feasible. While these building bricks, namely taxonomy-driven filtering, topic diversification, and the Appleseed trust metric, are vital for the conception of our trust-based decentralized recommender, they are also valuable contributions in their own right, addressing issues not only confined to the universe of de- centralized recommender systems.},

abstract = {Recommender systems, also known as personalization systems, are a popular technique for reducing information overload and finding items that are of interest to the user. Increasingly, people are turning to these systems to help them find the information that is most valuable to them. A variety of techniques have been proposed for performing recommendation, including content-based, collaborative, knowledge-based and other techniques. All of the known recommendation techniques have strengths and weaknesses, and many researchers have chosen to combine techniques in different ways. In this dissertation, we investigate the use of discrete choice models as a radically new technique for giving personalized recommendations. Discrete choice modeling allows the integration of item and user specific data as well as contextual information that may be crucial in some applications. By giving a general multidimensional model that depends on a range of inputs, discrete choice subsumes other techniques used in the literature. We present a software package that allows the adaptation of generalized discrete choice models to the recommendation task. Using a generalized framework that integrates recent advances and extensions of discrete choice allows the estimation of complex models that give a realistic representation of the behavior inherent in the choice process, and consequently a better understanding of behavior and improvements in predictions. Statistical learning, an important part of personalization, is realized using Bayesian procedures to update the model as more observations are collected. As a test bed for investigating the effectiveness of this approach, we explore the application of discrete choice as a solution to the problem of recommending academic courses to students. The goal is to facilitate the course selection task by recommending subjects that would satisfy students' personal preferences and suit their abilities and interests. A generalized mixed logit model is used to analyze survey and course evaluation data. The resulting model identifies factors that make an academic subject "recommendable". It is used as the backbone for the recommender system application. The dissertation finally presents the software architecture of this system to highlight the software package's adaptability and extensibility to other applications.},

abstract = {Social Web applications have emerged as powerful applications for Internet users al- lowing them to freely contribute to the Web content, organize and share information, and utilize the collective knowledge of others for discovering new topics, resources and new friends. While social Web applications such as social tagging systems have many benefits, they also present several challenges due to their open and adaptive nature. The amount of user generated data can be extremely large and since there is not any controlled vocabulary or hierarchy, it can be very difficult for users to find the information that is of their interest. In addition, attackers may attempt to distort the system’s adaptive behavior by inserting erroneous or misleading annotations, thus altering the way in which information is presented to legitimate users. This thesis utilizes data mining and machine learning techniques to address these problems. In particular, we design and develop recommender systems to aid the user in contributing to the Social Semantic Web. In addition, we study intelligent techniques to combat attacks against social tagging systems. In our work, we first propose a framework that maps domain properties to recommendation technologies. This framework provides a systematic approach to find the appropriate recommendation technology for addressing a given problem in a specific domain. Second, we improve existing graph-based approaches for personalized tag recommendation in folksonomies. Third, we develop machine learning algorithms for recommendation of semantic relations to support continuous ontology development in a social semanticWeb environment. Finally, we introduce a framework to analyze different types of potential attacks against social tagging systems and evaluate their impact on those systems.},

abstract = {Trust is the measure of willingness to believe in a user based on its competence and behavior within a specific context at a given time. Based on the active users’ trusts on the recommenders, the Trust-Aware Recommender System (TARS) suggests the worthwhile information to the users. TARS has superior rating prediction coverage than the traditional recommender system by taking advantages of the trust’s transitive property. The conventional TARS model suffers from several problems. Firstly, it is not optimized. This is because the structure of the dynamic trust model is unknown. The computational complexity of the conventional TARS model can be exponentially more expensive by achieving similar rating predication accuracy and rating prediction coverage. The rating prediction coverage of the conventional TARS model can also be significantly worse by achieving similar rating predication accuracy. Secondly, the conventional TARS model is only effective with the explicit trust statements, which means all the users should explicitly point out their opinions on other users. Since the explicit trusts need extra user effort, they are not always available in the practical recommender systems. This work first verifies that the trust network used in TARS has the small- world topology. Its small-worldness is independent of its dynamics. Taking advantages of the small-world properties of the trust network, this work optimizes the conventional TARS model to achieve the maximum rating prediction accuracy and the maximum rating prediction coverage with the minimum computational complexity. Secondly, this work improves the conventional TARS model to predict the ratings without the explicit trust statements. This is achieved by generating the implicit trust networks for TARS by the easy available trust sensitive information. Specifically, this work uses the user similarities to get the implicit trusts. By verifying the small-worldness of the implicit trust network, this work applies the small-worldness of the implicit trust network in the rating prediction mechanism of the improved TARS model. The simulation results show that the improved implicit trust based TARS model has high rating prediction accuracy and high rating prediction coverage.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are personalized information systems that learn individual preferences from interacting with users. Recommender systems use machine learning techniques to compute suggestions for the users. Supervised machine learning relies on optimizing for a suitable objective function. Suitability means here that the function actually reflects what users and operators consider to be a good system performance. Most of the academic literature on recommendation is about rating prediction. For two reasons, this is not the most practically relevant prediction task in the area of recommender systems: First, the important question is not now much a user will express to like a given item (by the rating), but rather which items a user will like. Second, obtaining explicit preference information like ratings requires additional actions from the side of the user, which always comes at a cost. Implicit feedback in the form of purchases, viewing times, clicks, etc., on the other hand, is abundant anyway. Very often, this implicit feedback is only present in the form of positive expressions of preference. In this work, we primarily consider item recommendation from positive-only feedback. A particular problem is the suggestion of new items – items that have no interaction data associated with them yet. This is an example of a cold-start scenario in recommender systems. Collaborative models like matrix factorization rely on interaction data to make predictions. We augment a matrix factorization model for item recommendation with a mechanism to estimate the latent factors of new items from their attributes (e.g. descriptive keywords). In particular, we demonstrate that optimizing the latent factor estimation with regard to the overall loss of the item recommendation task is superior to optimizing it with regard to the prediction error on the latent factors. The idea of estimating latent factors from attributes can be extended to other tasks (new users, rating prediction) and prediction models, yielding a general framework to deal with cold-start scenarios. Next, we adapt the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) framework, which is state of the art in item recommendation, to a setting where more popular items are more frequently encountered when making predictions. By generalizing even more, we get Weighted Bayesian Personalized Ranking, an extension of the BPR that allows importance wrights to be placed on specific users and items. All method contributions are supported by experiments using large-scale real-life datasets from various application areas like movie recommendation and music recommendation. Finally, this thesis presents an efficient and scalable free software package MyMediaLite, that implements, among other things, all the presented methods (plus related work) and evaluation protocols. Besides offering the existing models and evaluation protocols as a library and via command-line tools and web services. MyMediaLite allows the easy development of new models and learning methods.},

abstract = {The simplicity and flexibility of tagging allows users to collaboratively create large, loosely structured repositories of Web resources. One of its main drawbacks is the need for manual formulation of tags for each posted resource. This task can be eased by a tag recommendation system, the objective of which is to propose a set of tags for a given resource, user pair. Tag recommendation is an interesting and well-defined practical problem. Its main features are constant interaction with users and availability of large amounts of tagged data. Given the opportunities (e.g., rich user feedback) and limitations (e.g., real-time response) of the tag recommendation setting, we de- fined six requirements for a practically useful tag recommendation system. We present a conceptual design and system architecture of a hybrid tag recommendation system, which meets all these requirements. The system utilizes the strengths of various tag sources (e.g., resource content and user profiles) and the relations between concepts captured in tag co-occurrence graphs mined from collaborative actions of users. The architecture of the proposed system is based on a text indexing engine, which al- lows the system to deal with large datasets in real time, while constantly adapting its models to newly added posts. The effectiveness and efficiency of the system was evaluated for six datasets representing a broad range of collaborative tagging systems. The experiments confirmed the high quality of results and practical usability of the system. In a comparative study the system outperformed a state-of-the-art algorithm based on tensor factorization for the most representative datasets applicable to both methods. The experiments on the characteristics of tagging data and the performance of the system allowed us to find answers to important research questions adapted from the general area of recommender systems. We confirmed the importance of infrequently used tags in the recommendation process and proposed solutions to overcome the cold start problem in tag recommendation. We demonstrated that a parameter tuning approach makes a hybrid tag recommendation system adaptable to various datasets. We also revealed the importance of the utilization of a feedback loop in the tag recommendation process.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have been widely advocated as a way of coping with the problem of information overload for knowledge workers. Given this, multiple recommendation methods have been developed. However, it has been shown that no one technique is best for all users in all situations. Thus, we believe that effective recommender systems should incorporate a wide variety of such techniques and that some form of overarching framework should be put in place to coordinate the various recommendations so that only the best of them (from whatever source) are presented to the user. To this end, we show that a marketplace, in which the various recommendation methods compete to offer their recommendations to the user, can be used in this role. Specifically, our research is concerned with the principled design of such a marketplace (including the auction protocol, the reward mechanism and the bidding strategies of the individual recommender agents) and its evaluation in terms of how it can effectively coordinate multiple methods. In addition to the market mechanisms, a reinforcement learning strategy is developed to assist the individual recommender agents’ bidding behaviour so as to learn the users’ interests and still maximize their revenue. Finally, we evaluate our approach with a real market-based recommender system that is composed of a number of typical recommendation methods and that is evaluated with real users. The evaluation results show that our approach is indeed an effective means of coordinating multiple different recommendation methods in one single system and is an effective way of dealing with the problem of information overload.},

abstract = {This lecture addresses the issues of efficient music search, retrieval and recommendation in the setup of large collections of digital music. Music collections available over the World Wide Web or stored in personal collections on Mp3 players, PCs, and media centers have grown drastically. This explosion of digital music available on large-scale emerged into new ways of distributing, consuming, and searching for music. Music information retrieval and recommendation systems that retrieve music similar to other music, have consequently become more and more popular. These developments call for efficient data management and information retrieval techniques for large music collections. The thesis offers effective solutions to representation and querying of heterogeneous music data, retrieval of similar music, and user-oriented music recommendation and ranking, built on the assumption that music data and an associated notion of music similarity are available. The thesis presents a query framework for music data and playlist management. The framework addresses in a unified manner the various strategies of music recommendation and retrieval over large music databases. A song representation model is introduced, which captures heterogeneous music data and serves a foundation for query operators that offer a practical solution to playlist management. Various representations of music data are considered in the thesis, and approaches to improve the music similarity retrieval through data reduction are envisaged. Solutions for two different scenarios are proposed. One involves music data shaped as multi-dimensional time series and the reduction of the length of the time series, while the other involves dimensionality reduction on multi-dimensional audio features that capture the perceptual emotion of music. The thesis introduces a novel music-ranking method that manipulates hybrid music data, in the form of audio features combined with social media. The ranking method is based on kernels, and is capable of fusing similar and mainstream music according to the user’s needs. The thesis reports on a real user survey that confirms that the diverse needs of the users when searching for music are well addressed. The thesis also proposes a music recommendation approach that tackles the issue of the multi-modal perception of music by the users. The recommendation approach employs an algorithm that uses latent semantic analysis on music tagging data to find new associations among the users, tags, and musical items present in the initial data. It is envisaged that these discovered associations can be used for recommending musical items according to particular users’ perception of the music. The thesis rounds up with a comprehensive survey of existing music search and retrieval systems. Addressing the Web as a global-scale musical resource, the thesis points out specifications and challenges to be faced by future music search engines.},

abstract = {The Artificial Intelligence (AI) community has carried out a great deal of work on how AI can help people to find out what they want on the Internet. As a result, the idea of recommender systems has been widely accepted among users. The main task of a recommender system is to locate items, information sources and people related to the interest and preferences of a single person or a group of people. This involves the construction of user models and the ability to anticipate and predict user preferences. This thesis focusses on the study of AI techniques which improve the performance of recommender systems. Initially, a detailed analysis of the current state-of-the-art in this field has been carried out. This work has been organised as a taxonomy where existing recommender systems on the Internet are classified into 8 general dimensions. This taxonomy provides us with an indispensable knowledge base from which to design our proposal. Secondly, this thesis proposes a new CBR approach to recommendation. Case- based reasoning (CBR) is a paradigm for learning and reasoning through experience suitable for recommender systems due to its being based on human reasoning. We provide a forgetting mechanism for case-based profiles that controls the relevance and age of past experiences. Experimental results show that this proposal better adapts the profiles to users and solves the utility problem of CBR systems. Thirdly, this thesis proposes the “agentification” of recommender systems in order to take advantage of interesting agent properties such as proactivity, encapsulation or social ability. Recommender systems sharply improve the quality of results when information about other users is utilised when recommending a given user. Collaboration among agents is performed with the opinion-based filtering method and the collaborative filtering method through trust. Both are based on a social model of trust making agents less vulnerable to others while collaborating. Experimental results show that our collaborative recommender agents improve the performance of the system while preserving the privacy of the user’s personal data. Finally, this thesis also proposes an evaluation procedure for recommender systems that allows a scientific discussion of the results. This proposal simulates the users behaviour over time based on real user profiles. We hope this new evaluation methodology will contribute towards the progress in this area of research.},

abstract = {The importance of music recommender systems is increasing because most online services that manage large music collections cannot provide users with entirely satisfactory access to their collections. Many users of music streaming services want to discover “unknown” pieces that truly match their musical tastes even if these pieces are scarcely known by other users. Recommender systems should thus be able to select musical pieces that will likely be preferred by estimating user tastes. To develop a satisfactory system, it is essential to take into account the contents and ratings of musical pieces. Note that the content should be automatically analyzed from multiple viewpoints such as timbral and rhythmic aspects whereas the ratings are provided by users. We deal with hybrid music recommendation in this thesis based on users’ ratings and timbral and rhythmic features extracted from polyphonic musical audio signals. Our goal was to simultaneously satisfy six requirements: (1) accuracy, (2) diversity, (3) coverage, (4) promptness, (5) adaptability, and (6) scalability. To achieve this, we focused on a model-based hybrid filtering method that has been proposed in the field of document recommendation. This method can be used to make accurate and prompt recommendations with wide coverage and diversity in musical pieces, using a probabilistic generative model that unifies both content-based and rating-based data in a statistical way. To apply this method to enable satisfying music recommendation, we tackled four issues: (i) lack of adaptability, (ii) lack of scalability, (iii) no capabilities for using musical features, and (iv) no flexibility for integrating multiple aspects of music. To solve issue (i), we propose an incremental training method that partially updates the model to promptly reflect partial changes in the data (addition of rating scores and registration of new users and pieces) instead of training the entire model from scratch. To solve issue (ii), we propose a cluster-based training method that efficiently constructs the model at a fixed computational cost regardless of the numbers of users and pieces. To solve issue (iii), we propose a bag-of-features model that represents the time-series features of a musical piece as a set of existence probabilities of predefined features. To solve issue (iv), we propose a flexible method that integrates the musical features of timbral and rhythmic aspects into bag-of-features representations. In Chapter 3, we first explain the model-based method of hybrid filtering that takes into account both rating-based and content-based data, i.e., rating scores awarded by users and the musical features of audio signals. The probabilistic model can be used to formulate a generative mechanism that is assumed to lie behind the observed data from the viewpoint of probability theory. We then present incremental training and its application to cluster-based training. The model formulation enables us to incrementally update the partial parameters of the model according to the increase in observed data. Cluster- based training initially builds a compact model called a core model for fixed numbers of representative users and pieces, which are the centroids of clusters of similar users and pieces. To obtain the complete model, the core model is then extended by registering all users and pieces with incremental training. Finally, we describe the bag-of-features model to enable hybrid filtering to deal with musical features extracted from polyphonic audio signals. To capture the timbral aspects of music, we created a model for the distribution of Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). To also take into account the rhythmic aspects of music, we effectively combined rhythmic features based on drum-sound onsets with timbral features (MFCCs) by using principal component analysis (PCA). The onsets of drum sounds were automatically obtained as described in the next chapter. Chapter 4 describes a system that detects onsets of the bass drum, snare drum, and hi-hat cymbals from polyphonic audio signals. The system takes a template-matching- based approach that uses the power spectrograms of drum sounds as templates. However, there are two problems. The first is that no appropriate templates are known for all songs. The second is that it is difficult to detect drum-sound onsets in sound mixtures including various sounds. To solve these, we propose two methods of template adaptation and harmonic-structure suppression. First, an initial template for each drum sound (seed template) is prepared. The former method adapted it to actual drum-sound spectrograms appearing in the song spectrogram. To make our system robust to the overlapping of harmonic sounds with drum sounds, the latter method suppressed harmonic components in the song spectrogram. Experimental results with 70 popular songs demonstrated that our methods improved the recognition accuracy and respectively achieved 83\%, 58\%, and 46\% in detecting the onsets of the bass drum, snare drum, and hi-hat cymbals. In Chapter 5, we discuss the evaluation of our system by using audio signals from commercial CDs and their corresponding rating scores obtained from an e-commerce site. The results revealed that our system accurately recommended pieces including non-rated ones from a wide diversity of artists and maintained a high degree of accuracy even when new rating score, users, and pieces were added. Cluster-based training, which can speed up model training a hundred fold, had the potential to improve the accuracy of recommendations. That is, we found a breakthrough that overcame the trade-off, i.e., accuracy v.s. efficiency, which has been considered to be unavoidable. In addition, we verified the importance of timbral and rhythmic features in making accurate recommendations. Chapter 6 discusses the major contributions of this study to different research fields, particularly to music recommendation and music analysis. We also discuss issues that still remain to be resolved and future directions of research. Chapter 7 concludes this thesis.},

abstract = {For many users of information systems, “information overload” has become a problem: the amount of information they must sift through has reached the point where it is overwhelming. Collaborative Filtering (CF) techniques, which attempt to predict what information will meet a user’s needs based on data coming from similar users, are becoming increasingly popular as ways to combat this information overload. While accuracy has been a major focus of CF, in practice, efficiency, privacy, and reliability are also important issues in CF in order to enhance the performance, security, and robustness of CF systems. Efficiency refers to the computational cost of CF algorithms. We propose two efficient algorithms that are able to learn low-dimensional linear models (either unconstrained or non-negativity constrained) from a very large number of ratings. Privacy-preserving CF provides protection against divulgence of personal information. Ratings (and even their existence) can reveal information about individuals’ personal preferences. We introduce two data reconstruction methods to reveal limitations in existing privacy-preserving schemes and propose a new two-way communication scheme to help users preserve more privacy. Reliability is the ability to detect and prevent malicious attacks that might make specific items appear more or less popular than they truly are. We describe a series of approaches to detect a diverse and general set of recommendation attacks and demonstrate their effectiveness with data. The research work introduced in this thesis will benefit both users and implementers of information access systems. Research results will have significant implications for a variety of adaptive information systems that rely on users’ input for learning purposes.},

abstract = {Music consumption is biased towards a few popular artists. For instance, in 2007 only 1\% of all digital tracks accounted for 80\% of all sales. Similarly, 1,000 albums accounted for 50\% of all album sales, and 80\% of all albums sold were purchased less than 100 times. There is a need to assist people to filter, discover, personalise and recommend from the huge amount of music content available along the Long Tail. Current music recommendation algorithms try to accurately predict what people demand to listen to. However, quite often these algorithms tend to recommend popular —or well–known to the user—music, decreasing the effectiveness of the recommendations. These approaches focus on improving the accuracy of the recommendations. That is, try to make accurate predictions about what a user could listen to, or buy next, independently of how useful to the user could be the provided recommendations. In this Thesis we stress the importance of the user’s perceived quality of the recommendations. We model the Long Tail curve of artist popularity to predict —potentially— interesting and unknown music, hidden in the tail of the popularity curve. Effective recommendation systems should promote novel and relevant material (non–obvious recommendations), taken primarily from the tail of a popularity distribution. The main contributions of this Thesis are: (i) a novel network–based approach for recommender systems, based on the analysis of the item (or user) similarity graph, and the popularity of the items, (ii) a user–centric evaluation that measures the user’s relevance and novelty of the recommendations, and (iii) two prototype systems that implement the ideas derived from the theoretical work. Our findings have significant implications for recommender systems that assist users to explore the Long Tail, digging for content they might like.},

abstract = {It is not hyperbole to note that a revolution has occurred in the way that we as a society distribute data and information. This revolution has come about through the confluence of Web-related technologies and the approaching - universal adoption of internet connectivity. Add to this mix the normalised use of lossy compression in digital music and the increase in digital music download and streaming services; the result is an environment where nearly anyone can listen to nearly any piece of music nearly anywhere. This is in many respects the pinnacle in music access and availability. Yet, a listener is now faced with a dilemma of choice. Without being familiar with the ever-expanding millions of songs available, how does a listener know what to listen to? If a near-complete collection of recorded music is available what does one listen to next? While the world of music distribution underwent a revolution, the ubiquitous access and availability it created brought new problems in recommendation and discovery. In this thesis, a solution to these problems of recommendation and discovery is presented. We begin with an introduction to the core concepts around the playlist (i.e. sequential ordering of musical works). Next, we examine the history of the playlist as a recommendation technique, starting from before the invention of audio recording and moving through to modern automatic methods. This leads to an awareness that the creation of suitable playlists requires a high degree of knowledge of the relation between songs in a collection (e.g. song similarity). To better inform our base of knowledge of the relationships between songs we explore the use of social network analysis in combination with content-based music information retrieval. In an effort to show the promise of this more complex relational space, a fully automatic interactive radio system is proposed, using audio-content and social network data as a backbone. The implementation of the system is detailed. The creation of this system presents another problem in the area of evaluation. To that end, a novel distance metric between playlists is specified and tested. We then conclude with a discussion of what has been shown and what future work remains.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are one of the recent inventions to deal with ever growing information overload in relation to the selection of goods and services in a global economy. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most popular techniques in recommender systems. The CF recommends items to a target user based on the preferences of a set of similar users known as the neighbours, generated from a database made up of the preferences of past users. With sufficient background information of item ratings, its performance is promising enough but research shows that it performs very poorly in a cold start situation where there is not enough previous rating data. As an alternative to ratings, trust between the users could be used to choose the neighbour for recommendation making. Better recommendations can be achieved using an inferred trust network which mimics the real world “friend of a friend” recommendations. To extend the boundaries of the neighbour, an effective trust inference technique is required. This thesis proposes a trust interference technique called Directed Series Parallel Graph (DSPG) which performs better than other popular trust inference algorithms such as TidalTrust and MoleTrust. Another problem is that reliable explicit trust data is not always available. In real life, people trust “word of mouth” recommendations made by people with similar interests. This is often assumed in the recommender system. By conducting a survey, we can confirm that interest similarity has a positive relationship with trust and this can be used to generate a trust network for recommendation. In this research, we also propose a new method called SimTrust for developing trust networks based on user’s interest similarity in the absence of explicit trust data. To identify the interest similarity, we use user’s personalised tagging information. However, we are interested in what resources the user chooses to tag, rather than the text of the tag applied. The commonalities of the resources being tagged by the users can be used to form the neighbours used in the automated recommender system. Our experimental results show that our proposed tag- similarity based method outperforms the traditional collaborative filtering approach which usually uses rating data.},

abstract = {The amount of structured data available in our digital age is constantly growing and this calls for ways to analyze this data. One way for such analysis is through visualization, and structured data can typically be visualized as node-link graphs. Many tools are available for visualization of such node-link graphs. These tools often suffer from scalability issues, but more importantly they don’t offer meaningful interaction mechanisms for the user to explore the data. This dissertation work attempts to address both of these issues, by providing and evaluating scalable and useful interaction methods for graph visualization systems. Our work mainly focuses on what we call manipulation methods, which are a set of interaction methods that enable the user to interactively manipulate the layout of a node-link graph. We provide a survey of existing interaction methods and introduce our own methods. Methods range from more specialized techniques, such as for an interactive visual recommender system, to more general procedures, which can be applied to any node-link data. We demonstrate the benefits of these interaction methods over pre-existing methods, and we also show the benefits of manipulation methods in general over visualizations that don’t allow layout manipulation.},

abstract = {This thesis aims at improving content-based music recommender systems. Besides a general introduction to music recommendation and an in-depth discussion of evaluation methods of content-based music recommender systems, improvements on two different abstraction levels are considered in this thesis: The first and most obvious way to improve a content-based music recommender system is to improve the underlying music similarity measure that is used to generate the recommendations. State-of-the-art frame-level audio similarity algorithms are analyzed and improvements and limitations are discussed. Then a novel block- level feature extraction framework and a set of novel block-level features are introduced. To generate recommendations based on these block-level features two approaches are presented. One approach is based on directly estimating similarities based on the block-level features, and the other approach performs a mapping onto a semantic tag space before estimating pairwise song similarities. Finally, it is proposed to combine these two approaches. This combination approach ranked first in the MIREX 2010 Audio Music Similarity and Retrieval task. The second way of improving content-based music recommenders considers a more abstract level of a music recommendation system. At this higher level of abstraction a music recommender system is interpreted as a recommendation network. Based on the analysis of the emerging recommendation network it will be shown that a straightforward top-N recommendation approach can significantly impact the reachability of songs in a music recommendation network. This can radically reduce the usability of music recommender systems. Two strategies to alleviate this issue are presented and evaluated. It will be shown that both strategies can significantly improve the reachability of songs within a music recommendation network.},

abstract = {As online stores are offering an almost unlimited shelf space, users must increasingly rely on product search and recommender systems to find their most preferred products and decide which item is the truly best one to buy. However, much research work has emphasized on developing and improving the underlying algorithms whereas many of the user issues such as preference elicitation and trust formation received little attention. In this thesis, we aim at designing and evaluating various decision technologies, with emphases on how to improve users’ decision accuracy with intelligent preference elicitation and revision tools, and how to build their competence-inspired subjective constructs via trustworthy recommender interfaces. Specifically, two primary technologies are proposed: one is called example critiquing agents aimed to stimulate users to conduct tradeoff navigation and freely specify feedback criteria to example products; another termed as preference-based organization interfaces designed to take two roles: explaining to users why and how the recommendations are computed and displayed, and suggesting critique suggestions to guide users to understand existing tradeoff potentials and to make concrete decision navigations from the top candidate for better choices. To evaluate the two technologies’ true performance and benefits to real-users, an evaluation framework was first established, that includes important assessment standards such as the objective/subjective accuracy-effort measures and trust-related subjective aspects (e.g., competence perceptions and behavioral intentions). Based on the evaluation framework, a series of nine experiments has been conducted and most of them were participated by real-users. Three user studies focused on the example critiquing (EC) agent, which first identified the significant impact of tradeoff process with the help of EC on users’ decision accuracy improvement, and then in depth explored the advantage of multi-item strategy (for critiquing coverage) against single-item display, and higher user-control level reflected by EC in supporting users to freely compose critiquing criteria for both simple and complex tradeoffs. Another three experiments studied the preference-based organization technique. Regarding its explanation role, a carefully conducted user survey and a significant-scale quantitative evaluation both demonstrated that it can be likely to increase users’ competence perception and return intention, and reduce their cognitive effort in information searching, relative to the traditional “why” explanation method in ranked list views. In addition, a retrospective simulation revealed its superior algorithm accuracy in predicting critiques and product choices that real-users intended to make, in comparison with other typical critiquing generation approaches. Motivated by the empirically findings in terms of the two technologies’ respective strengths, a hybrid system has been developed with the purpose of combining them into a single application. The final three experiments evaluated its two design versions and particularly validated the hybrid system’s universal effectiveness among people from different types of cultural backgrounds: oriental culture and western culture. In the end, a set of design guidelines is derived from all of the experimental results. They should be helpful for the development of a preference-based recommender system, making it capable of practically benefiting its users in improving decision accuracy, expending effort they are willing to invest, and even promoting trust in the system with resulting behavioral intentions to purchase chosen products and return to the system for repeated uses.},

abstract = {The huge amount of information available in the Web poses various challenges to Web science researchers. Finding interesting and relevant pieces of information is like finding a needle in a haystack. Since most searchable information is either written in or described by natural language, efficient and effective methods to represent natural language are crucial. In this thesis we look into topic models and language models as a mean to structure, compress, and represent textual data. In particular, we look into latent Dirichlet allocation, a generative topic model, and its use for various task scenarios in the Web. We discuss advantages and disadvantages in comparison with language models in the context of common Web applications from areas such as information retrieval, recommender systems, and machine learning. In particular, we investigate the use of topic models and language models for filtering, classification, ranking, and recommendation. These are popular methods to cope with the information overload the average user has to deal with in the Web today. Many applications make use of these methods, such as Web search engines, Web 2.0 platforms, or recommender systems. We present different approaches based on topic model and language model representations for the individual tasks. Regarding the filtering of information, we propose an approach based on support vector machines to predict the importance of news articles. We compare the use of topic models and language models as the underlying representation of the newspaper articles to accurately predict important news automatically. Sentiment classification deals with automatically detecting the polarity of texts. This is often done by looking-up sentiment scores for each term in a document in a lexicon. We propose a context-dependent sentiment lexicon based on latent topics identified by latent Dirichlet allocation. The most common task in the Web is probably the ranking of information. The huge success of search engines from Google or Yahoo! is based on sophisticated ranking algorithms. We look into diversification of rankings to cover the information needs of as many users as possible. Therefore we not only investigate diversification of Web search results, but also diversification of product review rankings. The recommendation of products, friends, news, or events is very popular in e-commerce sites like Amazon, or social Web applications like Facebook. We propose an approach for tag recommendation within folksonomies. We show that combining topic models to overcome the cold start problem with language models to personalize the recommendations is very successful.},

abstract = {Cluster analysis is a fundamental research field in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD). It aims at partitioning a given dataset into some homogeneous clusters so as to reflect the natural hidden data structure. Various heuristic or statistical approaches have been developed for analyzing propositional datasets. Nevertheless, in relational clustering the existence of multi-type relationships will greatly degrade the performance of traditional clustering algorithms. This issue motivates us to find more effective algorithms to conduct the cluster analysis upon relational datasets. In this thesis we comprehensively study the idea of Representative Objects for approximating data distribution and then design a multi-phase clustering framework for analyzing relational datasets with high effectiveness and efficiency. The second task considered in this thesis is to provide some better data models for people as well as machines to browse and navigate a dataset. The hierarchical taxonomy is widely used for this purpose. Compared with manually created taxonomies, automatically derived ones are more appealing because of their low creation/maintenance cost and high scalability. Up to now, the taxonomy generation techniques are mainly used to organize document corpus. We investigate the possibility of utilizing them upon relational datasets and then propose some algorithmic improvements. Another non-trivial problem is how to assign suitable labels for the taxonomic nodes so as to credibly summarize the content of each node. Unfortunately, this field has not been investigated sufficiently to the best of our knowledge, and so we attempt to fill the gap by proposing some novel approaches.},

abstract = {This work presents the results of a research and development project dealing with automated recommendation systems in an industrial context, at Orange company (France Telecom Group). Chapter 1 of this thesis provides a formal framework to the automatic recommendation, and provides standardization and formalization of core functions. We list the possible modes of recommendation, crossing the main objects or attributes manipulated by a recommendation system: items, metadata about items, users, socio-demographic data on users. We identify the various types of data sources used for a recommendation engine. We end up with four types of recommendations (item-to-items, item-to-users, user-to-users, user-to-items). Then we propose four core features of the automatic recommendation: Help to Decide: predicting a rating for a user for an item Help to Compare : rank a list of items in a personalized way for a user Help to Discover: provide a user with unknown items that will be appreciated Help to Explore: give items similar to a given target item The first two features require a personalized scoring primitive function of an item for a user, the last feature requires a similarity function between objects. The "Help to Explore" feature requires the use of a primitive function of similarity between two objects. The "Help to Discover" feature can be implemented by one primitive or the other. We propose a classification of Recommender Systems (R.S.) not based on the data source, but based on the primitive functions: a scoring engine, a similarity engine, and, for the last emerging category, a tags engine. In Chapter 2, the state of the art, we identify the main techniques used by the automatic recommendation systems. Three features attracted our attention: the association rules, the K- Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) methods and the fast matrix factorization methods, especially a method called Gravity. We consider that the KNN methods correspond to a generalization of the association rules method and are more flexible. We therefore focus on the presentation of KNN and fast matrix factorization algorithms. We give an overview of different systems to show the diversity and richness of recommender engines' technology, while using as magnifying glass the first chapter to analyze it. The second stage of this work was the creation of a recommendation system to meet industrial needs. Chapter 3 describes an automatic recommendation system designed and developed in Orange, the Reperio engine. This is an automatic recommendation engine using a KNN method as kernel. Its first version was developed in 2007 and was operational in the same year. Since then it has been used in operational services of France Telecom. The recommendation engine Reperio allowed us to study the key factors that influence the performance of systems based on KNN methods. In chapter 3 we show that the KNN methods are very competitive as long as you use good similarity measures to define neighborhoods. We introduce an appropriate modification of the Pearson similarity and demonstrate its efficiency. We show that the KNN methods are fully adapted to the functions and requirements defined in Chapter 1: KNN methods allow us to build industrial engines recommendation both generic and flexible. We also show that hybridization techniques, and content-based recommendations are well adapted to cold start issue especially if user profiles are small. However, with profiles of sufficient size (over 20 ratings), a purely collaborative system becomes after a few hundred users more efficient. These results are of course related to a given size catalog (around 20,000 items). The third stage of this work is the proposal of an evaluation process of automatic recommendation systems. This methodology is based on the combination of the four core functions tasks of a recommendation system:  Help to Decide,  Help to Compare,  Help to Discover,  Help to Explore, taking into account the different behaviors of the following segments:  heavy users and popular items,  heavy users and unpopular items,  light users and popular items,  light users and unpopular items. We experience this method by comparing four recommendation algorithms: two major methods of the state of the art: KNN and Gravity and two simple methods: a random predictor, and a default predictor based on the average users' and items' ratings. We show that the two major methods are rather complementary as they perform differently across the different segments. We show that we could use the two algorithms together, for instance to produce a KNN matrix based on the dimension reduction done by Gravity, with still a correct quality. Gravity could be used to implement a "Help to Explore" function, and Gravity could be used as a component for fast KNN search. We introduce a new measure, the Average Measure of Impact, to deal with the usefulness and the trust of the recommendations. Many algorithms and systems are evaluated only using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and assuming that the lower the RMSE the higher the quality of the recommendation. We show that there is no clear correlation between RMSE measures and other quality measures of the recommendation. This fact strongly justifies our protocol, which independently evaluate the four core functions. We have demonstrated the utility of our protocol as it may change  the classical vision of the recommendation evaluation, often focused on the RMSE/MAE measures as they are assumed correlated with the system overall performances,  and the way to design the recommender systems to achieve their tasks. When designing a recommender engine 's general recommendation strategy, we have to think about the impact of the recommender: recommending popular items to heavy users might be not so useful. On the other hand, it can be illusory to make personalized recommendations of unpopular and unknown items to light and unknown users. A possible simple strategy could be:  Use personalized algorithms to recommend popular items to light users.  Use personalized algorithms to recommend unpopular items of the long tails for heavy users. Note: This thesis focuses on the automatic recommendation systems: for example, we excluded from this study editorial recommendation systems that can be managed by tools such as Content Management System (CMS) and the so-called recommendations to my friends, which can be a messaging system, or discussion forums coupled with a product catalog. We focus on automated systems, although the strict distinctions with other forms of more human recommendations is not perceived for people outside the community, particularly for marketing services},

abstract = {This thesis describes work on using content to improve recommendation systems. Personalised recommendations help potential buyers filter information and identify products that they might be interested in. Current recommender systems are based mainly on collaborative filtering (CF) methods, which suffer from two main problems: (1) the ramp-up problem, where items that do not have a sufficient amount of meta-data associated with them cannot be recommended; and (2) lack of transparency due to the fact that recommendations produced by the system are not clearly explained. In this thesis we tackle both of these problems. We outline a framework for generating more accurate recommendations that are based solely on available textual content or in combination with rating information. In particular, we show how content in the form of social tags can help improve recommendations in the book and movie domains. We address the ramp-up problem and show how in cases where they do not exist, social tags can be automatically predicted from available textual content, such as the full texts of books. We evaluate our methods using two sets of data that differ in product type and size. Finally we show how once products are selected to be recommended, social tags can be used to explain the recommendations. We conduct a web-based study to evaluate different styles of explanations and demonstrate how tag-based explanations outperform a common CF-based explanation and how a textual review-like explanation yields the best results in helping users predict how much they will like the recommended items.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are intelligent tools that help on-line users to tame information overload. Most of the current recommender systems assume that users’ preferences do not change quickly and previously recorded observations about what users like or dislike can help in predicting their future choices. This assumption is valid only to some extent. In fact, users’ general interests can be relatively stable, but they can also be influenced by many additional and varying factors, here referred as context. For example, weather could play an important role while choosing between going to a beach or visiting an indoor museum. In the thesis I have studied how contextual information could be exploited to improve the prediction accuracy of Recommender Systems based on the Collaborative Filtering technique. Within this thesis we analyzed several new methods and techniques to perform context-aware Collaborative Filtering. We have also introduced and investigated a comprehensive development methodology for context-aware system. It consists of a two steps data gathering process and a specialized model-based rating prediction algorithm. We validated this methodology on a mobile recommender that provides real-time context-aware recommendations and can explain such recommendations on the base of the acquired contextual information. We have shown in an experimental study that our context-aware methods can increase the prediction accuracy compared to some context-free approaches and other state of the art context-aware methods. In addition, we carried out a user study that showed that the proposed techniques can also increase the user satisfaction.},

abstract = {This research investigates how synergies between the Web and social networks can enhance the process of obtaining relevant and trustworthy information. A review of literature on personalised search, social search, recommender systems, social networks and trust propagation reveals limitations of existing technology in areas such as relevance, collaboration, task-adaptivity and trust. In response to these limitations I present a Web-based approach to information-seeking using social networks. This approach takes a source-centric perspective on the information-seeking process, aiming to identify trustworthy sources of relevant information from within the user's social network. An empirical study of source-selection decisions in information- and recommendation- seeking identified five factors that influence the choice of source, and its perceived trustworthiness. The priority given to each of these factors was found to vary according to the criticality and subjectivity of the task. A series of algorithms have been developed that operationalise three of these factors (expertise, experience, affinity) and generate from various data sources a number of trust metrics for use in social network-based information seeking. The most significant of these data sources is Revyu.com, a reviewing and rating Web site implemented as part of this research, that takes input from regular users and makes it available on the Semantic Web for easy re-use by the implemented algorithms. Output of the algorithms is used in Hoonoh.com, a Semantic Web-based system that has been developed to support users in identifying relevant and trustworthy information sources within their social networks. Evaluation of this system's ability to predict source selections showed more promising results for the experience factor than for expertise or affinity. This may be attributed to the greater demands these two factors place in terms of input data. Limitations of the work and opportunities for future research are discussed.},

abstract = {The growing amount of multimedia content is making it hard for end users to find the relevant content. The goal of recommender systems is to assist the users by finding a small subset of relevant multimedia items for each user. Since each user has her/his own specific preferences, a recommender system must account for individual differences when filtering relevant content. One way of improving the performance of recommender systems is to improve the underlying algorithms, the other possibility is to use novel features that account for the unexplained variance in end users’ preferences. The progress beyond the state of the art of the present thesis consists in introducing new parameters based on emotion and personality that explain a substantial part of variance of end users’ preferences. These users’ preferences are usually expressed as ratings (e.g. Likert ratings or binary ratings like it / don’t like it) and rep- resent the ground truth upon which the system relies. In a user centric recommender system, the emotions detected in an unobtrusivemanner can be a useful indicator of the users’ preferences. A recommender system is a model that uses input parameters (knowledge) to predict the user preferences/behaviour (explicit user’s ratings) and thus recommend content. The variance in user preferences is not explained well enough with the parameters currently used in recommender systems. We contributed to the identification of important factors in recommender systems that extend the part of explained variance by showing that emotions (attributes describing the users’ emotive responses, e.g. valence, arousal etc.) and personality (attributes describing the users’ personality, e.g. extraversion, neuroticism etc.) are parameters that ac- count for a substantial part of the variance. As a consequence the success rate of the recommender system under observation has improved. Several recommender systems have been developed in the last 15 years using different approaches, which can be classified into two distinct groups: content based recommenders (CBR) and collaborative filtering recommenders (CF). CBR systems use parameters, which we refer to as generic metadata (e.g. actors, genre, subject matter etc.). For ex- ample different users have different preferences about actors in movies so the parameter actors can explain a part of the variance of user preferences for movies. Our assumption is that end users differ also in their preferences about the emotions that were induced by watching the con- tent. Pure CF systems build their knowledge upon the relations between users of the system. These relations in the form of user similarities are computed based on the ratings of different users on overlapping content items. This approach usually yields good recommendation accuracy on a wide range of applications. However it fails to perform well when a new user joins the system because there are no, or there are very few, over- lapping ratings with other users. This is known as the cold start problem or the new user problem. When the system is in the new user mode the main parameter of the system, the vector of user similarities, is more a vector of random values and thus does not contribute to the variance of user ratings. We showed that personality attributes could be used in- stead for calculating the user similarities when there are not enough over- lapping ratings. In fact, personality accounts for individual differences in their enduring emotional, interpersonal, experiential, attitudinal and motivational styles. The presented thesis describes four novel scientific contributions: (i) a new CBR modeling approach based on affective metadata, (ii) a new personality based user similarity measure for a CF recommender, (iii) an emotion detection algorithm that uses the video recordings of users in spontaneous emotion expressions and (iv) a dataset that supports the first three contributions. We built a dataset, named LDOS-PerAff-1, that features almost six hours of 52 subjects face video recordings with 70 different induced emotive states. The video sequences are annotated with big-five personality parameters of subjects and metadata related to the items. Further- more the dataset is freely available to the scientific community, which can make good use of it with its personality annotations that makes it unique. Our modeling of users with affective metadata in a CBR system showed that the usage of the proposed solution brings significant improvement over generic metadata. We presented a simple yet efficient method for modeling items and users through the first two statistical moments of the users’ emotive responses in the valence-arousal-dominance space. Our experimental results also indicate that the Support Vector Machine algorithm is a good candidate for the calculation of items’ rating estimates. Finally we showed that among the proposed affective features, the first statistical moments carry more information for the separation of relevant items from non relevant than the second statistical moments. We presented a novel user similarity measure. It is based on users’ personalities and has content related properties. The proposed personality based USM yielded significantly better results than the standard rating based USM used in state of the art recommenders under the new user conditions. Results have shown that personality based USM are apromising approach. The major limitation is the non trivial acquisition of personality information because it is annoying for the user to fill in extensive questionnaires and because it contains sensitive data that users are not necessarily willing to provide. We presented a methodology for the detection of emotions from video sequences of users’ faces. We evaluated the performance of the methodology on affective labeling on a dataset of posed face expressions and on a dataset of spontaneous face expressions. We used Gabor filtering based low level features, PCA for dimensionality reduction and the kNN classifier for affective labeling. The emotion detection accuracy on the posed expressions dataset was 92\% and on the spontaneous expressions dataset 62\%. We identified a number of reasons why the accuracy on spontaneous data is inferior than the accuracy on the posed dataset. Although the reported results are in line with similar research work we conclude that the presented methodology is not suitable for affective labeling for CBR systems.},

abstract = {Product Recommendation Agents (PRAs) and other web-based decision aids are deployed extensively by online vendors, to provide virtual advising services to their customers. While the design of PRA functionality has received increasing amount of attention in academic studies, the social aspects of human-PRA interactions are comparatively less studied. This dissertation investigates the potential of enhancing users’ social experiences with PRAs by developing and analyzing an anthropomorphic interface, which has humanoid embodiment and voice output. This dissertation first investigates the importance of choosing appropriate demographic embodiments for a humanoid PRA. The two demographic variables that have been assessed are ethnicity and gender. As suggested by similarity-attraction theories and social-identity theories, results of a laboratory experiment have revealed that users apply similar social stereotypes in human-human communications as they apply to evaluate humanoid agents. PRAs that match the ethnicity of users are perceived by the users as more sociable, more competent, and more enjoyable to interact with than PRAs that do not match users’ ethnicity; as well, same-gender PRAs are perceived as more competent and more honest than opposite-gender agents. In addition, the "match-up" effects of ethnicity appear to be more significant among female users than among males. Two interface components are also empirically investigated in this dissertation: (1) presence of a humanoid embodiment and (2) output modalities (text, computer-synthesized voice, or human voice). Results from a laboratory experiment demonstrate that humanoid embodiments increase consumers’ perception of a PRA’s social presence, their beliefs in its competence, and the enjoyment they derive from interaction with the PRA. A human voice also appears to be significantly more effective than on-screen text and computer-synthesized voice in improving the PRA’s perceived social presence and enjoyment. Furthermore, the important role of social relationships in influencing user adoption of agents is tested by integrating social presence, trust , and perceived enjoyment with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Social presence appears to be a common antecedent of both trust and perceived enjoyment. Trust exerts a direct impact on user intentions to adopt PRAs, as well as an indirect impact via user perceptions of PRAs’ usefulness. Perceived enjoyment also influences adoption intentions through perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use.},

abstract = {Recommender systems such as Amazon, offer users recommendations, or suggestions of items to try or buy. These recommendations can then be explained to the user, e.g. “You might (not) like this item because...”. We propose a novel classification of reasons for including explanations in recommender systems. Our focus is on the aim of effectiveness, or decision support, and we contrast it with other metrics such as satisfaction and persuasion. Effective explanations should be helpful in the sense that they help users find items that they like (even after trying them), and discard items they would not like. In user studies, we found that people varied in the features they found important, and composed a short list of features in two domains (movies and cameras). We then built a natural language explanation generation testbed system, considering these features as well as the limitations of using commercial data. This testbed was used in a series of experiments to test whether personalization of explanations affects effectiveness, persuasion and satisfaction. We chose a simple form of personalization which considers likely constraints of a recommender system (e.g. limited meta-data related to the user) as well as brevity (assuming users want to browse items relatively quickly). In these experiments we found that: 1. Explanations help participants to make decisions compared to recommendations without explanations, we we saw as a significant decrease in opt-outs in item ratings - participants were more likely to be able to give an initial rating for an item if they were given an explanation, and the likelihood of receiving a rating increased for feature-based explanations compared to a baseline. 2. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, our method of personalization could damage effectiveness for both movies and cameras which are domains that differ with regard to two dimensions which we found affected perceived effectiveness: cost (low vs. high), and valuation type (subjective vs. objective). 3. Participants were more satisfied with feature-based than baseline explanations. If the personalization is perceived as relevant to them, then personalized feature-based explanations were preferred over non-personalized. 4. Satisfaction with explanations was also reflected in the proportion of opt-outs. The opt-out rate for the explanations was highest in the baseline for all experiments. This was the case despite the different types of explanation baselines used in the two domains.},

abstract = {E-commerce firms are increasingly adopting recommendation systems to effectively target customers with products and services. The first essay examines the impact that improving a recommender system has on firms that deploy such systems. A market with customers heterogeneous in their search costs is considered. We find that in a monopoly, a firm always increases its profit by improving its recommender system; interestingly, decreasing the price may be optimal when a small reduction in price significantly increases the market size of the firm. In a duopoly with firms asymmetric in their recommender system effectiveness, we show that both firms may find it optimal to reduce their prices simultaneously under certain conditions. When the firm with recommender system of higher effectiveness improves its system, both firms increase their profits by increasing their prices. In the second essay, we develop an algorithm to generate a novel kind of association rules, referred to as disjunctive consequent rules that are suitable for recommending multiple items for web- based retailing. Traditional rules with single or conjunctive consequents are of limited use in such environments. Experiments conducted rules on real datasets show that the accuracies of recommendations made using disjunctive consequent rules are significantly higher than those made using traditional association rules. The third essay develops a probabilistic framework for combining association rules in order to base recommendations on as many items of a customer’s basket as possible. Traditional rule-based systems typically rely on identifying one among several eligible rules in order to make recommendations, ignoring information from other eligible rules that can potentially improve recommendations. We present a probability-based approach to combine multiple rules when making recommendations. When multiple combinations exist, we propose a maximum-likelihood approach to identify the best combination. Experiments show that the accuracies of recommendations improve significantly when items are recommended using multiple rules instead of single rules.},

abstract = {This thesis is about how Bayesian methods can be applied to explicitly model and efficiently reason about uncertainty to make optimal recommendations. We are interested in three dimensions of recommender systems: (1) preference elicitation, (2) set-based recommendations, and (3) matchmaking. The first dimension concerns how one can minimize the elicitation efforts in learning a user’s utility function to propose the maximal utility recommendation. The second dimension concerns set-based recommendations, and the problem of how one can optimize the relevance of the recommended set, with respect to uncertainty over the relevance of each item in the set. The third dimension concerns the problem of matchmaking, which is the process of pairing competitors based on similar latent skill levels, given match outcomes, e.g., score, or win/lose/draw. All three dimensions face an inherent problem of handling uncertainty: user utility uncertainty for preference elicitation, query topic uncertainty for set-based retrieval in the context of document retrieval, and skill uncertainty in match- making. Bayesian approaches prove to be extremely flexible in modeling various problems, and are robust to risk. However, it is not until recently that efficient Bayesian inference techniques have been introduced for complex models. Thus, we utilize recent advances in Bayesian approaches for addressing these three problems. Our contributions in the thesis are twofold. First, we present compact Bayesian graphical models for dimensions (1)–(3). Second, for each dimension, we make use of advanced Bayesian inference techniques to learn and make optimal recommendations.},

abstract = {A challenging problem in the user profiling domain is to create profiles of users of retrieval systems. This problem even exacerbates in the multimedia domain. Due to the Semantic Gap, the difference between low-level data representation of videos and the higher concepts users associate with videos, it is not trivial to understand the content of multimedia documents and to find other documents that the users might be interested in. A promising approach to ease this problem is to set multimedia documents into their semantic contexts. The semantic context can lead to a better understanding of the personal interests. Knowing the context of a video is useful for recommending users videos that match their information need. By exploiting these contexts, videos can also be linked to other, contextually related videos. From a user profiling point of view, these links can be of high value to recommend semantically related videos, hence creating a semantic-based user profile. This thesis introduces a semantic user profiling approach for news video retrieval, which exploits a generic ontology to put news stories into its context. Major challenges which inhibit the creation of such semantic user profiles are the identification of user’s long-term interests and the adaptation of retrieval results based on these personal interests. Most personalisation services rely on users explicitly specifying preferences, a common approach in the text retrieval domain. By giving explicit feedback, users are forced to update their need, which can be problematic when their information need is vague. Furthermore, users tend not to provide enough feedback on which to base an adaptive retrieval algorithm. Deviating from the method of explicitly asking the user to rate the relevance of retrieval results, the use of implicit feedback techniques helps by learning user interests unobtrusively. The main advantage is that users are relieved from providing feedback. A disadvantage is that information gathered using implicit techniques is less accurate than information based on explicit feedback. In this thesis, we focus on three main research questions. First of all, we study whether implicit relevance feedback, which is provided while interacting with a video retrieval system, can be employed to bridge the Semantic Gap. We therefore first identify implicit indicators of relevance by analysing representative video retrieval inter- faces. Studying whether these indicators can be exploited as implicit feedback within short retrieval sessions, we recommend video documents based on implicit actions per- formed by a community of users. Secondly, implicit relevance feedback is studied as potential source to build user profiles and hence to identify users’ long-term interests in specific topics. This includes studying the identification of different aspects of interests and storing these interests in dynamic user profiles. Finally, we study how this feedback can be exploited to adapt retrieval results or to recommend related videos that match the users’ interests. We analyse our research questions by performing both simulation-based and user-centred evaluation studies. The results suggest that implicit relevance feedback can be employed in the video domain and that semantic-based user profiles have the potential to improve video exploration.},

abstract = {The explosive growth of the World-Wide-Web and the emergence of ecommerce are the major two factors that have led to the development of recommender systems (Resnick and Varian, 1997). The main task of recommender systems is to learn from users and recommend items (e.g. information, products or books) that match the users’ personal preferences. Recommender systems have been an active research area for more than a decade. Many different techniques and systems with distinct strengths have been developed to generate better quality recommendations. One of the main factors that affect recommenders’ recommendation quality is the amount of information resources that are available to the recommenders. The main feature of the recommender systems is their ability to make personalised recommendations for different individuals. However, for many ecommerce sites, it is difficult for them to obtain sufficient knowledge about their users. Hence, the recommendations they provided to their users are often poor and not personalised. This information insufficiency problem is commonly referred to as the cold-start problem. Most existing research on recommender systems focus on developing techniques to better utilise the available information resources to achieve better recommendation quality. However, while the amount of available data and information remains insufficient, these techniques can only provide limited improvements to the overall recommendation quality. In this thesis, a novel and intuitive approach towards improving recommendation quality and alleviating the cold-start problem is attempted. This approach is enriching the information resources. It can be easily observed that when there is sufficient information and knowledge base to support recommendation making, even the simplest recommender systems can outperform the sophisticated ones with limited information resources. Two possible strategies are suggested in this thesis to achieve the proposed information enrichment for recommenders:  The first strategy suggests that information resources can be enriched by considering other information or data facets. Specifically, a taxonomy-based recommender, Hybrid Taxonomy Recommender (HTR), is presented in this thesis. HTR exploits the relationship between users’ taxonomic preferences and item preferences from the combination of the widely available product taxonomic information and the existing user rating data, and it then utilises this taxonomic preference to item preference relation to generate high quality recommendations.  The second strategy suggests that information resources can be enriched simply by obtaining information resources from other parties. In this thesis, a distributed recommender framework, Ecommerce-oriented Distributed Recommender System (EDRS), is proposed. The proposed EDRS allows multiple recommenders from different parties (i.e. organisations or ecommerce sites) to share recommendations and information resources with each other in order to improve their recommendation quality. Based on the results obtained from the experiments conducted in this thesis, the proposed systems and techniques have achieved great improvement in both making quality recommendations and alleviating the cold-start problem.},

In this framework, information delivered to the user can be automatically per- sonalized and catered to individual user’s information needs. However, a practical concern for such a personalized system is the “cold start problem”: any user new to the system must endure poor initial performance until sufficient feed- back from that user is provided. To solve this problem, we use both explicit and implicit feedback to build a user’s profile and use Bayesian hierarchi- cal methods to borrow information from existing users. We analyze the usefulness of implicit feedback and the adap- tive performance of the model on two data sets gathered from user studies where users’ interaction with a document, or implicit feedback, were recorded along with explicit feed- back. Our results are two-fold: first, we demonstrate that the Bayesian modeling approach effectively trades off be- tween shared and user-specific information, alleviating poor initial performance for each user. Second, we find that im- plicit feedback has very limited unstable predictive value by itself and only marginal value when combined with explicit feedback.},

Recent studies have shown that recom- mender systems have a positive effect on the provider’s revenue. In this paper we show that by providing a set of recommenda- tions different than the one perceived best according to user ac- ceptance rate, the recommendation system can further increase the business’ utility (e.g. revenue), without any significant drop in user satisfaction. Indeed, the recommendation system designer should have in mind both the user, whose taste we need to reveal, and the business, which wants to promote specific content. We performed a large body of experiments comparing a commer- cial state-of-the-art recommendation engine with a modified rec- ommendation list, which takes into account the utility (or revenue) which the business obtains from each suggestion that is accepted by the user. We show that the modified recommendation list is more desirable for the business, as the end result gives the business a higher utility (or revenue). To study possible reduce in satisfaction by providing the user worse suggestions, we asked the users how they perceive the list of recommendation that they received. Dif- ferences in user satisfaction between the lists is negligible, and not statistically significant. We also uncover a phenomenon where movie consumers prefer watching and even paying for movies that they have already seen in the past than movies that are new to them.},

abstract = {Web-based catch-up TV has revolutionised watching habits as it provides users the opportunity to watch programs at their preferred time and place, using a variety of devices. With the increasing offer of TV content, there is an emer- gent need for personalised recommendation solutions, which help users to select programs of interest. In this work, we study the watching patterns of users of an Australian nation- wide catch-up TV service provider and develop a suite of approaches for a catch-up recommendation scenario. We evaluate these approaches using a new large-scale dataset gathered by theWeb-based catch-up portal deployed by the provider. The evaluation allows us to compare the perfor- mance of several recommenders that address the discovery of both TV programs already watched by users and new programs that users may find relevant.},

This paper also describes various limitations of current recommendation methods and discusses possible extensions that can improve recommendation capabilities and make recommender systems applicable to an even broader range of applications. These extensions include, among others, an improvement of understanding of users and items, incorporation of the contextual information into the recommendation process, support for multicriteria ratings, and a provision of more flexible and less intrusive types of recommendations.},

abstract = {Although temporal context may significantly affect the popularity of items and user preference over items, traditional information filtering techniques such as recommender systems have not sufficiently considered temporal factors. Modeling temporal dynamics in user behavior is not trivial, and it is challenging to study its effect in order to provide better recommendation results to users. To incorporate temporal effects into information filtering systems, we analyze a large sized real-world usage log data gathered from Bugs Music, which is one of the well-known online music service in Korea, and study temporal dynamics in users' music listening behaviors considering periodicity of time dimension and popularity change. We insist that the result of our analysis can be a useful guideline to the industry which delivers music items to users and tries to consider temporal context in their recommendations.},

@article{Guo2011a,
abstract = {This thesis is about how Bayesian methods can be applied to explicitly model and efficiently reason about uncertainty to make optimal recommendations. We are interested in three dimensions of recommender systems: (1) preference elicitation, (2) set-based recommendations, and (3) matchmaking. The first dimension concerns how one can minimize the elicitation efforts in learning a user’s utility function to propose the maximal utility recommendation. The second dimension concerns set-based recommendations, and the problem of how one can optimize the relevance of the recommended set, with respect to uncertainty over the relevance of each item in the set. The third dimension concerns the problem of matchmaking, which is the process of pairing competitors based on similar latent skill levels, given match outcomes, e.g., score, or win/lose/draw. All three dimensions face an inherent problem of handling uncertainty: user utility uncertainty for preference elicitation, query topic uncertainty for set-based retrieval in the context of document retrieval, and skill uncertainty in match- making. Bayesian approaches prove to be extremely flexible in modeling various problems, and are robust to risk. However, it is not until recently that efficient Bayesian inference techniques have been introduced for complex models. Thus, we utilize recent advances in Bayesian approaches for addressing these three problems. Our contributions in the thesis are twofold. First, we present compact Bayesian graphical models for dimensions (1)–(3). Second, for each dimension, we make use of advanced Bayesian inference techniques to learn and make optimal recommendations.},
